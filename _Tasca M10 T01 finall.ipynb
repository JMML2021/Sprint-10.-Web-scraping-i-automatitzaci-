Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?

This body will be able to raise salaries and improve working and training conditions. It will also issue guidelines for a sector that has a high turnover in California, considered the fifth-largest economy in the world.', 'The Fast Food Council will be made up of 10 members, with equal numbers of workers’ delegates and employers’ representatives. It has carte blanche to issue recommendations for the industry. This includes raising the minimum wage from the current $15.50 an hour to $22, which would make it one of the highest in the country. The council may also study any proposal backed by at least 10,000 fast food workers.', '“Today’s action gives hardworking fast-food workers a stronger voice and seat at the table to set fair wages and critical health and safety standards across the industry,” ', '. Last week, when the law was approved by the California Senate, it was still unclear whether the governor had enough support to pass the measure in the Assembly. Some members of his own party had criticized the initiative, and employers had openly repudiated it. The California government, however, now describes the initiative as a way to promote sectoral collective bargaining.', 'In California, the fast food workforce is more than 60% Latino, according to research from the University of California in Los Angeles and UC Berkeley.', 'Under the law, the Fast Food Council model could be replicated on a local level in cities and counties with more than 200,000 inhabitants. Only chains that have more than 100 restaurants throughout the country will be subject to the new rule. The restriction is intended to protect small businesses, but critics are concerned about how it will affect the more than 16,700 franchises in California.', 'The law is seen as the latest progressive step in the ', 'that have swept the United States. Since December, employees at more than 200 Starbucks coffee shops and an Amazon warehouse have unionized. For a decade, fast food workers have been calling for the minimum wage to be raised to at least $15 an hour. On May 21, hundreds of McDonald’s employees in 16 cities in the country – including three in California – protested to demand the pay raise. The demonstration came a day before the burger chain held its annual shareholder meeting. Last year, McDonald’s set the minimum wage at $13 for most of its restaurants.', 'Kate Andrias, an employment law expert at Columbia University, called the Californian initiative “one of the most important state laws passed in a long time.” Labor organizations have also applauded the measure, which they believe will empower workers. “The passage of AB257 is the most significant advance in workers’ fight for fairness on the job in a generation,” said Mary Kay Henry, president of the ', ', an organization with more than two million members. “It’s time for corporations like McDonald’s, Amazon, Starbucks and Delta to come to a national bargaining table to raise industry standards and ensure that every employee is respected, protected and paid a living wage,” she added.', 'Passing the bill has been a long process. Last year, it did not receive enough votes in the California State Assembly, partly due to the pressure and lobby campaign of fast food chains. The text of the norm was picked up again in January, but several changes had to be made to appease the business sector and center-leaning congress members. One change, for example, was the elimination of a clause that made franchise owners responsible for violations committed by the parent company. This was deleted from the text because some argued that it could affect the economy and reduce the number of new franchises in the future.', 'In June, the California Department of Finance opposed the new law in a fiscal analysis. “It creates a sector-specific rule-making body within DIR [Department of Industrial Relations], which could lead to a fragmented regulatory and legal environment for employers and raise long-term costs across industries,”', '. Indeed, many critics of the law believe it will force fast food restaurants to increase prices – a blow to a sector whose business is based on attracting low-income consumers with affordable meals.']}\n",

The restriction is intended to protect small businesses, but critics are concerned about how it will affect the more than 16,700 franchises in California.', 'The law is seen as the latest progressive step in the ', 'that have swept the United States. Since December, employees at more than 200 Starbucks coffee shops and an Amazon warehouse have unionized. For a decade, fast food workers have been calling for the minimum wage to be raised to at least $15 an hour. On May 21, hundreds of McDonald’s employees in 16 cities in the country – including three in California – protested to demand the pay raise. The demonstration came a day before the burger chain held its annual shareholder meeting. Last year, McDonald’s set the minimum wage at $13 for most of its restaurants.', 'Kate Andrias, an employment law expert at Columbia University, called the Californian initiative “one of the most important state laws passed in a long time.” Labor organizations have also applauded the measure, which they believe will empower workers. “The passage of AB257 is the most significant advance in workers’ fight for fairness on the job in a generation,” said Mary Kay Henry, president of the ', ', an organization with more than two million members. “It’s time for corporations like McDonald’s, Amazon, Starbucks and Delta to come to a national bargaining table to raise industry standards and ensure that every employee is respected, protected and paid a living wage,” she added.', 'Passing the bill has been a long process. Last year, it did not receive enough votes in the California State Assembly, partly due to the pressure and lobby campaign of fast food chains. The text of the norm was picked up again in January, but several changes had to be made to appease the business sector and center-leaning congress members. One change, for example, was the elimination of a clause that made franchise owners responsible for violations committed by the parent company. This was deleted from the text because some argued that it could affect the economy and reduce the number of new franchises in the future.', 'In June, the California Department of Finance opposed the new law in a fiscal analysis. “It creates a sector-specific rule-making body within DIR [Department of Industrial Relations], which could lead to a fragmented regulatory and legal environment for employers and raise long-term costs across industries,”', '. Indeed, many critics of the law believe it will force fast food restaurants to increase prices – a blow to a sector whose business is based on attracting low-income consumers with affordable meals.']}\n",

However, the Royal Entomological Society of London estimates that, in total, there could be up to 10 million. Nonetheless, despite the large number of species of these arthropods that exist, they have not always been studied to the same extent as other animals, according to José Carlos Otero, Professor Emeritus Ad Honorem at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. But this is changing: “Now they are beginning to be studied a lot because we are realizing that they are absolutely necessary for the survival of the human species, that is, that many things that the ecosystem services provide us come from the insects,” he explains. Recently, a group of researchers tried to provide an answer to a debate that has been open for several years: are insects capable of feeling pain? For this, they reviewed the available literature, whose conclusion confirms that insects do have the necessary mechanisms to experience suffering. However, these results – they explain – are not definitive proof, and must be complemented in the future with further behavioral, psychological and hormonal work', 'Lars Chittka, Professor of Sensory and Behavioral Ecology at Queen Mary University of London and one of the authors of the study, explains that it is important to be certain about this matter at a time in which the insect industry is growing as an option of consumption for people, as well as for livestock. In 2013, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recommended eating insects to fight hunger, and defined these animals as an important and easily accessible ', '.', 'The researcher, who recently published a book entitled ', ', asserts that there is no legal framework for the use of these insects in the case of the industry, but neither in the case of research, and he urges to properly understand what happens with them before the same mistakes that happened with the raising of other animals, like the case of chickens, are repeated. Otero also advocates for the legislation of this matter, especially the way of slaughtering them, as he is convinced that they do suffer.', 'Nociception is the sensory mechanism that allows animals to sense and avoid potentially harmful stimuli, according to research published in ', '. An example of this concept happens when one is exposed to something very hot and specialized receptors in the skin respond to that stimulus to quickly move away from it. This is present in all animals, Chittka points out, and has been extensively studied in insects. But nociception is not necessarily evidence that the animal actually experiences some kind of subjective sensation of unpleasantness in its mind; that is, pain.', 'It is important to distinguish between this reflex response and pain. Although the nociceptive responses are almost automatic – explains the author – a reflex of the control of the central nervous system of peripheral sensation shows that it is flexible and can be ', '. To put it in simple words, he uses the example of a wounded soldier on a battlefield that is not aware of an injury until he returns to his shelter: this is a consequence of his endogenous opiate system. In that sense, the existence of this kind of central nervous modulation of the sensation of a potentially harmful stimulus can be proven, indicating that there is plasticity that comes with actual pain, not just with the perception, he adds. And this is what they have concluded that insects have. Neural pathways and molecular building blocks are necessary in this process.', 'In addition to analyzing if insects suffer from pain, a team of researchers went a step further and published a study in 2019 stating that some of these animals can experience chronic pain, which lasts long after an initial wound has healed. In this research, published in the scientific journal ', ', they damaged a nerve in the leg of a fruit fly. Once the wound healed, the fly’s other legs had become hypersensitive.']}\n",

However, these results – they explain – are not definitive proof, and must be complemented in the future with further behavioral, psychological and hormonal work', 'Lars Chittka, Professor of Sensory and Behavioral Ecology at Queen Mary University of London and one of the authors of the study, explains that it is important to be certain about this matter at a time in which the insect industry is growing as an option of consumption for people, as well as for livestock. In 2013, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recommended eating insects to fight hunger, and defined these animals as an important and easily accessible ', '.', 'The researcher, who recently published a book entitled ', ', asserts that there is no legal framework for the use of these insects in the case of the industry, but neither in the case of research, and he urges to properly understand what happens with them before the same mistakes that happened with the raising of other animals, like the case of chickens, are repeated. Otero also advocates for the legislation of this matter, especially the way of slaughtering them, as he is convinced that they do suffer.', 'Nociception is the sensory mechanism that allows animals to sense and avoid potentially harmful stimuli, according to research published in ', '. An example of this concept happens when one is exposed to something very hot and specialized receptors in the skin respond to that stimulus to quickly move away from it. This is present in all animals, Chittka points out, and has been extensively studied in insects. But nociception is not necessarily evidence that the animal actually experiences some kind of subjective sensation of unpleasantness in its mind; that is, pain.', 'It is important to distinguish between this reflex response and pain. Although the nociceptive responses are almost automatic – explains the author – a reflex of the control of the central nervous system of peripheral sensation shows that it is flexible and can be ', '. To put it in simple words, he uses the example of a wounded soldier on a battlefield that is not aware of an injury until he returns to his shelter: this is a consequence of his endogenous opiate system. In that sense, the existence of this kind of central nervous modulation of the sensation of a potentially harmful stimulus can be proven, indicating that there is plasticity that comes with actual pain, not just with the perception, he adds. And this is what they have concluded that insects have. Neural pathways and molecular building blocks are necessary in this process.', 'In addition to analyzing if insects suffer from pain, a team of researchers went a step further and published a study in 2019 stating that some of these animals can experience chronic pain, which lasts long after an initial wound has healed. In this research, published in the scientific journal ', ', they damaged a nerve in the leg of a fruit fly. Once the wound healed, the fly’s other legs had become hypersensitive.']}\n",

The protected area, one of the country’s most important natural reserves, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, no longer has its own natural fresh water. The Santa Olalla lagoon, the largest of the permanent bodies of water, which quenches the thirst of ', ' and mammals, has dried up, leaving the rest of the wetlands dry. It is one of many ravages caused by the lack of rain, which has harmed hundreds of species of fauna and vegetation, some of which may disappear.', '“It is assumed that there is no water at all in the entire park. I have seen the deterioration over two months. The birds were gathering, and the lagoon was full of flamingos, until suddenly they all disappeared,” says biologist Carmen Díaz, a researcher at the Doñana Biological Station. Santa Olalla once covered 45 hectares. “Today there is a puddle of one meter by two meters,” she says.', 'Two years ago, the government declared the body of water “overexploited” and urged action to restore the water table of yesteryear. The Santa Olalla lagoon has only dried up twice before in recorded history, in 1995 and 1983, after several years of drought. In 2004, an AHS airborne sensor mapped Doñana and identified 2,867 bodies of water on the edge of the Guadalquivir river marsh. Nearly two decades later, all that water is gone. The lake’s disappearance is due ', ' for intensive strawberry farming and human consumption in the nearby resort town of Matalascañas.', 'This winter’s lack of rain was particularly dire for the reserve. It rained roughly half of what was expected. Over the last 40 years, an annual average of 540mm of rainfall has been recorded at Doñana, but between September 1, 2021 and May 31, the Palacio de Doñana station only detected 282mm of rainfall. Protected species such ', ', the imperial eagle and the spur-thighed tortoise suffer from the water shortage. The director of the Doñana Biological Station, Eloy Revilla, warns of the necessary shift that many sectors are putting off: “Doñana serves as a sentinel. First it passes through the most fragile areas, then into the marshlands where the harvests are already very poor. We humans will be next. Climate change makes less water available to us. We have to adapt now, not ', ', to avoid traumatic effects on agriculture and industry.”', 'Biologists and hydrogeologists have warned since 1988 of the effects of Matalascañas, less than a kilometer from the northernmost lagoons of the reserve, and the illegal wells, which the Guadalquivir Water Authority rarely persecuted until 2019. Their warnings, however, fell on deaf ears. The aquifer of 2,409 square kilometers has large empty areas, as evidenced by the lagoons that have disappeared on the surface.', '“The fauna of macrovertebrates is sustained by the lagoons, but if there are no shelters they go further or die. It is a loss of biodiversity for the whole of Europe. Everything that is strictly aquatic has died, including the eel, which is in danger of extinction, and other species of fish such as cornets and aquatic insects. Plants and amphibians may resist, but not for so long,” says Díaz from the Department of Wetland Ecology of the Doñana Biological Station, part of Spain’s National Research Council (CSIC). This summer, mammals have quenched their thirst at ', ', small ditches dug by environmental technicians to provide artificial watering holes.', 'Santa Olalla has now become a dangerous quagmire for birds, who search for water but sink and get trapped. Díaz recounts how a colleague recently tried to save a flamingo chick at the bottom of the lagoon, but had to abandon the rescue because he himself was sinking in the mud. Meanwhile, a colt was trapped and attacked by vultures. The lagoon’s salinity is also now very high: a month ago it had 38 millisiemens per centimeter (the unit used by experts), compared to a normal level of 3 and a sea water level of 50.', 'The Water Authority, meanwhile, continues to seal off illegal wells in the region. Since 2018, environmental agents have closed 220 wells, but when they close one, the farmers tend to open up another. It pays off: the economic benefits of the strawberry harvest exceed the amount of the fines.', 'Matalascañas is supplied by five wells, which extract 2.75 cubic hectometres of water per year. Now authorities are planning to close the two closest wells to Doñana and open another two at the western end, in the direction of the city of Huelva. Have they reacted too late? “No action has been taken. In Matalascañas the grass continues to be watered and the swimming pools filled. There is no limitation on consumption,” Revilla says. Díaz clarifies: “Of course the extractions have an influence. We got [more water] because the golf course was closed. But we have to insist that the politicians give up their plans.”', 'The biologist is alluding to the plans of the conservative Popular Party (PP), which is in power in the southern region of Andalusia with an absolute majority. In January, the regional government presented a proposal to increase the irrigation of berries over 1,460 hectares on the edge of Doñana. The bill was rejected in the last elections in June, but the party expects to put it on the table again. The initiative comes despite the strong opposition of the European Commission –which threatened Spain with million-euro fines–, UNESCO, the Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition, 25 scientific societies and 1,109 scientists and 23 European supermarket chains. The PP’s plans contravene the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which a year ago condemned Spain for failing to protect Doñana.', 'Regarding the plan, Revilla warns, “We cannot promise farmers that they will have more water and then let their companies collapse.” Díaz suggests a solution to stop the plans of the Andalusian right and save Doñana from the massive looting caused by the strawberry plantations and Matalascañas: “Regional premier Juan Manuel Moreno should come see what is there. Politicians only come to Santa Olalla when it is beautiful.”']}\n",

Plants and amphibians may resist, but not for so long,” says Díaz from the Department of Wetland Ecology of the Doñana Biological Station, part of Spain’s National Research Council (CSIC). This summer, mammals have quenched their thirst at ', ', small ditches dug by environmental technicians to provide artificial watering holes.', 'Santa Olalla has now become a dangerous quagmire for birds, who search for water but sink and get trapped. Díaz recounts how a colleague recently tried to save a flamingo chick at the bottom of the lagoon, but had to abandon the rescue because he himself was sinking in the mud. Meanwhile, a colt was trapped and attacked by vultures. The lagoon’s salinity is also now very high: a month ago it had 38 millisiemens per centimeter (the unit used by experts), compared to a normal level of 3 and a sea water level of 50.', 'The Water Authority, meanwhile, continues to seal off illegal wells in the region. Since 2018, environmental agents have closed 220 wells, but when they close one, the farmers tend to open up another. It pays off: the economic benefits of the strawberry harvest exceed the amount of the fines.', 'Matalascañas is supplied by five wells, which extract 2.75 cubic hectometres of water per year. Now authorities are planning to close the two closest wells to Doñana and open another two at the western end, in the direction of the city of Huelva. Have they reacted too late? “No action has been taken. In Matalascañas the grass continues to be watered and the swimming pools filled. There is no limitation on consumption,” Revilla says. Díaz clarifies: “Of course the extractions have an influence. We got [more water] because the golf course was closed. But we have to insist that the politicians give up their plans.”', 'The biologist is alluding to the plans of the conservative Popular Party (PP), which is in power in the southern region of Andalusia with an absolute majority. In January, the regional government presented a proposal to increase the irrigation of berries over 1,460 hectares on the edge of Doñana. The bill was rejected in the last elections in June, but the party expects to put it on the table again. The initiative comes despite the strong opposition of the European Commission –which threatened Spain with million-euro fines–, UNESCO, the Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition, 25 scientific societies and 1,109 scientists and 23 European supermarket chains. The PP’s plans contravene the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which a year ago condemned Spain for failing to protect Doñana.', 'Regarding the plan, Revilla warns, “We cannot promise farmers that they will have more water and then let their companies collapse.” Díaz suggests a solution to stop the plans of the Andalusian right and save Doñana from the massive looting caused by the strawberry plantations and Matalascañas: “Regional premier Juan Manuel Moreno should come see what is there. Politicians only come to Santa Olalla when it is beautiful.”']}\n",

Youth unemployment stands at 18.4%, well-above the average of the European Union (13.9%) or the United States (7.8%). The entry of 10.76 million recent college graduates into the market this summer will grow that number even further.', 'Experts say that the massive confinements, together with constant PCR testing, are mainly responsible for this economic anemia. “The only predictable thing about China right now is its unpredictability, and that is poison for the business climate,” said Bettina Schoen-Behanzin, the VP of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, at the presentation of her institution’s annual report on the confidence of European companies in the Asian country.

But analysts from Nomura Holdings note that although the reopening of cities “has raised optimism in the short-term, we do not see it as a change in trend, given that the Covid-zero policy will continue until the beginning of 2023.” Possible risks in the coming months are new lockdowns to stem Covid outbreaks, drastic corrections to support the weakened housing market, or problems related to the high debt of local governments.', 'Although performing below original forecasts, and far from repeating the driving role it played in the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese economy will continue to grow. “China is not going to enter a recession,” says Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia at the investment bank Natixis.

A taxi union wrote a letter to then-Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, saying the partnership weakened competition, drove down worker wages by undercutting prices and violated taxi laws. They even accused Uber of tax evasion and bribery.', '“Is it a normal practice for the largest state bank of the Russian Federation to advertise services, potentially dangerous for citizens?” the drivers asked in the letter. “Why does Sberbank offer the most expensive and complicated lease and loan deals to others and special favorable conditions to Uber?”', 'Emails show the Uber-Sberbank relationship was kickstarted, in part, by Plouffe, who met with Gref during a summer trip to Russia in 2015. Throughout the life of the relationship, Sberbank was under ', ', first prompted by Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.', 'Plouffe did not respond to questions about his role in Uber’s pursuit of influential Russian investors. Gref did not respond to questions.', 'Hazelbaker said Uber would not engage in any relationship with Sberbank or Gref today. She added the investment would not have violated US sanctions at the time.', 'Emails also show that discussions about a deal with LetterOne developed in late 2015. Then in late January 2016, Travis Kalanick met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland with Alexey Reznikovich, the managing partner of LetterOne Technology, a unit of LetterOne Holdings. “Strong meeting,” a meeting summary states. “Looks like we are close to a deal.”', 'Devon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for Kalanick, said Kalanick’s efforts to expand Uber’s business into Russia were limited to a trip to Russia and a few meetings. She said he “was asked for his involvement following Uber’s robust legal, policy, business development teams having vetted and approved the strategy and operations plans.”', 'Spurgeon added: “Mr. Kalanick is not aware of anyone acting on Uber’s behalf in Russia who engaged in any conduct that would have violated either Russian or U.S. law.”', 'Kalanick resigned in 2017 after a series of company scandals but stayed on the board of directors until the end of 2019.', 'Company executives’ efforts to win favor with LetterOne led to a February 2016 announcement that the oligarch-owned investment firm had bought a $200 million stake in Uber as part of a “strategic partnership.”', 'Part of that deal was kept private: Uber had offered the investment firm $50 million in stock warrants, representing the right to purchase Uber stock at a set price. According to an email from Uber’s public policy executive MacGann, the offer was made to encourage the firm to help Uber politically in Russia and to underwrite “the day-to-day heavy lifting that they would undertake on our behalf in the Duma and with the presidential administration.”', 'Documents show that LetterOne executives were helpful in connecting Uber with other influential Russians. For example, they connected Uber with Alfa Bank’s deputy chairman, Vladimir Senin, who, according to an Uber memo, managed to slip key pro-Uber provisions into a federal taxi bill. The bill didn’t become law, however.', 'According to the Uber Files, Uber signed a deal with Senin, now a member of the Duma, to help Uber on both the legislative and regulatory fronts. Uber consultant, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, is quoted in one document saying Senin “had been paid properly for his support.” In response to questions, Hazelbaker confirmed that Uber paid at least $300,000 for Senin’s “government relations work.”', 'Uber’s then head of business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa Fraser Robinson told colleagues that Uber’s lawyers were concerned that hiring Senin on top of providing LetterOne with stock warrants could breach the US law against bribing foreign officials. The lawyers warned that payments could be seen as bribes to “grease the skids,” Robinson said.', 'Robinson did not comment on any potential US anti-corruption violations. Hazelbaker said Uber would not do business with Senin today.', 'In response to ICIJ’s questions, MacGann said he did not support payments to Senin. “I had concerns about LetterOne’s insistence that we pay large sums of money to one of Alfa Bank’s top executives,” he said.', 'LetterOne, in a written statement, said that neither the firm nor its co-founders ever lobbied for Uber and that Senin’s role was “entirely at the discretion of and the responsibility of Uber.”', 'Aven said he had nothing to do with any Uber stock warrant deal or lobbying. “I stay absolutely out of politics,” he said in a telephone call with ICIJ’s partner ', 'Fridman, also in a phone call with ', ', said he “was not involved with the Uber investment or with any lobbying.”', 'Uber denied paying stock warrants in exchange for a lobbyist delivering favorable rules or laws. “The warrants vested based on Uber’s relative growth in Russia, as measured by the number of trips happening in the country,” Hazelbaker said.', 'The “Taming the Bear” memo noted that Uber had the “personal support” of Fridman, Aven and Gref. “With their support we have, in theory, a direct line into the Kremlin,” the memo said. “The personal involvement of Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven (L1) and Herman Gref (Sberbank), all of whom are very close to Vladimir Putin, means that (in principle) we have access to top-level political guidance and support.”', 'An email from Uber’s MacGann says that LetterOne principals also agreed to help in Belarus, a former Soviet satellite that remains under heavy Kremlin influence. As authorities in Belarus’ capital were revoking Uber drivers’ licenses and demanding driver tax data, LetterOne co-owner Aven planned to step in and “push these points to the Deputy Prime Minister in Minsk,” the email from MacGann said.', 'In a phone call with', ', Aven denied intervening in Belarus.', 'The LetterOne relationship was arranged partly by Lord Peter Mandelson, a former UK government minister, and Wegg-Prosser, former communications director to Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Uber Files show. Their strategic advisory firm, Global Counsel, provided intel on Russian influencers with “close links and loyalty to Kremlin.” Wegg-Prosser was in direct contact with LetterOne’s Petr Aven, asking if he could set up a meeting between Uber and Putin’s chief of staff. In 2016, Global Counsel had an $87,000-a-month contract with Uber, leaked emails show. During the first few months of that year, a fourth of its compensation would pay for its work on Russia.', 'In response to questions from ICIJ partner ', ', a spokesman for Global Counsel said Uber appointed the firm to “provide advice regarding the company’s international strategy,” and that all Global Counsel’s advice followed relevant European Union and UK guidelines.', 'The Uber Files also show Uber offered stock warrants to USM, the holding company co-owned by the Uzbek-born oligarch Usmanov. The value of those warrants was $2 million, a USM spokesman said.', 'He said there were no political overtones to the deal and that it’s “absurd to suggest that the holding or its shareholders could act as ‘political lobbyists’ for Uber.”', '“Mr Usmanov never met with any of Uber’s representatives,” he said.', 'Despite its efforts, Uber’s Russia venture didn’t work out.', 'In 2017, Uber agreed to merge its Russia business with the Russian internet company Yandex, which operates a ride-hailing service, into a $3.7 billion joint venture controlled by Yandex. Since then, Uber has sold more of its stake.', 'After this year’s ', ', Uber announced plans to cut its financial ties with Russia entirely.']}\n",

We don’t know yet how much interest rates will go up.', 'Will inflation remain at current levels much longer?', 'I think we are nearing the top and then prices could start to drop. But again I insist that it is difficult to make forecasts. In recent years we’ve had the largest monetary and fiscal stimuli injections the world has seen in its entire history. It is complex to guess the short-term consequences of these policies. What does seem to be clearer is that inflation is not transitory. Wages are going up, house prices too...', 'Do you think central banks have contributed to runaway inflation?', 'Yes, but not on purpose.

On the other hand, the purchase of public debt has clear inflationary effects, much more than a simple program of quantitative easing', ' In the United States, the scope of the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in just two years equals 30% of GDP.

However, I insist that we have never experienced such an injection of liquidity and, therefore, we are not capable of measuring its consequences. I understand that central banks want to fight inflation, reducing growth a bit, but not throwing the world into a recession.

I am glad to see Western countries working together to meet these challenges.', 'Will the energy crisis slow down the transition to renewable sources? Are you in favor of giving more importance to security of supply than to other environmental issues?', 'The war has changed many things, but even without this distorting factor we must be more rational when thinking about this energy transition. There is no alternative to betting on renewable sources. There were many people who thought that ', ' and nuclear power plants would solve the problem. However, the world still consumes 100 million barrels of oil per day and a huge amount of gas. The climate threat is real, it is there, and we have to work to combat it. But we need more rational energy policies. The best transition is to replace coal with gas. But now we are seeing how many countries are turning to coal because they cannot afford the high prices of hydrocarbons.

His professional godfather was the legendary banker Sandy Weill. Dimon went with him to Baltimore to work at Commercial Credit.

Dimon, after reluctantly accepting state aid because he argued he could function without a ventilator, took advantage of the Great Recession to push JPMorgan, then the nation’s third-largest bank, into the top spot. The Federal Reserve needed the solvent firms to take over the weaker ones, and Dimon jumped at the chance. Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual passed into his domains. They were risky operations because no one knew at the time what was on the banks’ balance sheets, but they were bought at knockdown prices. Dimon is the only survivor of the generation of managers who headed the big Wall Street banks when the financial crisis hit.', 'Do you see any similarities between the crisis the economy is now facing and the situation experienced after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers?', 'The situations are completely different. In the financial crisis, the world was massively over-indebted. Not only the banks were leveraged, but also the venture capital funds, the hedge funds... In addition, there were many vehicles off the banks’ balance sheets, mortgages had grown dramatically regardless of the situation of who signed them... Now, on the other hand, the situation is much better. Households have paid off most of their debts and are in generally good financial health. The problem of leverage is, on the other hand, being felt by states.', 'How’s JPMorgan doing?', 'Very strong. In fact, we have always been strong. We are one of the most stable banks you will find. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, which allows us to help our clients all over the world.', 'Are the major banks, including JPMorgan, too big to fail in a crisis?', 'Regulators around the world have learned that no one is too big to fail. People should also know that the bankruptcy of a bank ends up being paid by the rest of the banks. One lesson that has remained is that a case like Lehman’s cannot happen again. At this time, Lehman would have been much better capitalized and, in any case, its fall would be much more orderly, not like what happened back then, when the money fled and the system was about to collapse. In addition, with the pandemic it has also become clear that there are many companies, not just banks, that under certain extreme circumstances need public help to survive.', 'What do you think about ', '? Are they rivals or allies?', 'Both. Twenty years ago you had to compete with rival banks wherever you opened business. Now, in addition to those banks, you have to fight with the shadow banks, the ', ' and even the technological giants. We are partners with some of them, but we compete against all of them. There is going to be a very tough battle and not everyone will survive it. A lot of people will suffer as the match heats up.

But again I insist that it is difficult to make forecasts. In recent years we’ve had the largest monetary and fiscal stimuli injections the world has seen in its entire history. It is complex to guess the short-term consequences of these policies. What does seem to be clearer is that inflation is not transitory. Wages are going up, house prices too...', 'Do you think central banks have contributed to runaway inflation?', 'Yes, but not on purpose. I have always thought that zero interest rate policy was a bad idea. It has many detrimental effects. On the other hand, the purchase of public debt has clear inflationary effects, much more than a simple program of quantitative easing', ' In the United States, the scope of the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in just two years equals 30% of GDP.

Dimon received EL PAÍS in the first interview to a Spanish media outlet in the 16 years he has been at the helm of JP Morgan Chase.

Do you fear that the end of monetary stimulus will cause a new debt crisis in the euro zone?', 'I don’t have an answer to that question. It’s possible, but I hope it doesn’t happen. I think we have all learned lessons from what happened then. However, I insist that we have never experienced such an injection of liquidity and, therefore, we are not capable of measuring its consequences. I understand that central banks want to fight inflation, reducing growth a bit, but not throwing the world into a recession. Unlike the previous crisis, if we now had a recession, governments are much more indebted, and that is a risk, but households and businesses are in a better position now than in 2008.', 'Do you think that the North-South debate on fiscal and monetary policies can resurface in Europe?', 'That debate is over.', 'Has the Russian invasion of Ukraine precipitated ', '?', 'War is an opportunity to unite the Western world. We must defend democracy, fight for freedom and free trade. The world changed on February 24, when 3,000 Russian tanks invaded a European country. Such a blow shatters the illusion that all is good and peaceful. The war also puts the spotlight not just on global security, but on energy and food security. I am glad to see Western countries working together to meet these challenges.', 'Will the energy crisis slow down the transition to renewable sources? Are you in favor of giving more importance to security of supply than to other environmental issues?', 'The war has changed many things, but even without this distorting factor we must be more rational when thinking about this energy transition. There is no alternative to betting on renewable sources. There were many people who thought that ', ' and nuclear power plants would solve the problem. However, the world still consumes 100 million barrels of oil per day and a huge amount of gas. The climate threat is real, it is there, and we have to work to combat it. But we need more rational energy policies. The best transition is to replace coal with gas. But now we are seeing how many countries are turning to coal because they cannot afford the high prices of hydrocarbons. It’s happening in Germany, in the Netherlands, in India and in China.', 'Speaking of China, Beijing’s growth model has more and more cracks, now aggravated by its zero-covid policy. How do you see the economy of the Asian giant?', 'China can do one thing the rest of us can’t: run a country’s economy with a group of people sitting around a table. That gives them a lot of control, but it is true that they will have to lower their growth forecasts.

His professional godfather was the legendary banker Sandy Weill. Dimon went with him to Baltimore to work at Commercial Credit. This entity, which eventually became Travelers, merged in 1998 with Citicorp in a $70 billion mega-operation dollars that produced Citigroup. He was at the top, but his mentor fired him at the end of the same year, ending a 15-year professional relationship. Weill confessed to ', ' that Dimon was aiming for the CEO job, but he wasn’t ready to retire just yet.', 'After a hiatus, Dimon became Bank One’s chief executive in 2000, a role he held until its merger with JPMorgan in 2004. He spent a year as chief operating officer of the resulting entity and on January 1, 2006 was appointed CEO of JPMorgan.', 'Three years later, the financial crisis caused by subprime loans broke out. Dimon, after reluctantly accepting state aid because he argued he could function without a ventilator, took advantage of the Great Recession to push JPMorgan, then the nation’s third-largest bank, into the top spot. The Federal Reserve needed the solvent firms to take over the weaker ones, and Dimon jumped at the chance. Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual passed into his domains. They were risky operations because no one knew at the time what was on the banks’ balance sheets, but they were bought at knockdown prices. Dimon is the only survivor of the generation of managers who headed the big Wall Street banks when the financial crisis hit.', 'Do you see any similarities between the crisis the economy is now facing and the situation experienced after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers?', 'The situations are completely different. In the financial crisis, the world was massively over-indebted. Not only the banks were leveraged, but also the venture capital funds, the hedge funds... In addition, there were many vehicles off the banks’ balance sheets, mortgages had grown dramatically regardless of the situation of who signed them... Now, on the other hand, the situation is much better. Households have paid off most of their debts and are in generally good financial health. The problem of leverage is, on the other hand, being felt by states.', 'How’s JPMorgan doing?', 'Very strong. In fact, we have always been strong. We are one of the most stable banks you will find. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, which allows us to help our clients all over the world.', 'Are the major banks, including JPMorgan, too big to fail in a crisis?', 'Regulators around the world have learned that no one is too big to fail. People should also know that the bankruptcy of a bank ends up being paid by the rest of the banks. One lesson that has remained is that a case like Lehman’s cannot happen again. At this time, Lehman would have been much better capitalized and, in any case, its fall would be much more orderly, not like what happened back then, when the money fled and the system was about to collapse. In addition, with the pandemic it has also become clear that there are many companies, not just banks, that under certain extreme circumstances need public help to survive.', 'What do you think about ', '? Are they rivals or allies?', 'Both. Twenty years ago you had to compete with rival banks wherever you opened business.

Reserves of the Russian Federation in foreign currencies worth around $300 billion are blocked in accounts under Western jurisdictions.

The Russian economy will not collapse, says the expert, but the country will be more isolated.', 'This is the overall picture of an economic battle with far-reaching consequences. Around 40 countries, representing more than half of the world economy, have adopted different types of sanctions against Russia. The main ones affect the energy sector (the bans on the purchase of fossil fuels), the financial sector (the freezing of assets and reserves and the exclusion of several Russian entities from the SWIFT system), the trade sector (the ban on selling Russia products with strategic technologies or buying gold), and the transportation sector (the veto on flights from Russian territory). This situation not only affects the specific countries involved, but also has global repercussions. Here is an explainer of how the sanctions are affecting the main sectors.', 'Are the energy sanctions working? The answer is no, according to Simone Tagliapietra, an analyst specializing in this matter at the Bruegel think tank, because so far Europeans have not done anything other than announcing measures. The coal ban will take effect in August; the ban on oil imports by sea, at the end of the year. According to Tagliapietra, Europe’s hesitation – its announcement of future measures instead of immediate action – is a strategic mistake. Crude oil prices have risen, China and India are importing more than before, Europeans have not reduced imports by much, and the Russians are gaining. As for gas, while the Europeans have not had the courage to do something, the Russians are taking action, restricting supplies to several European countries.', 'A study published in mid-June by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air noted that Russia made close to €93 billion from fossil fuel exports in the first 100 days after the invasion, of which some €57 billion were purchased by the European Union. European spending, Tagliapietra points out, continues, and that figure is now close to €66 billion. Bloomberg indicates that India’s energy imports from Russia between March and May increased fivefold, compared to the same period of the previous year; China has doubled that value.', 'In this context, the Kremlin has been able to mitigate the impact of the sanctions on its economy by having a fund for social protection and stimulus measures. GDP contraction forecasts had reached -12%, and now Russian leaders are beginning to point to a milder margin of -3% to -5%. Finance firm JPMorgan places the 2022 recession at around -3.5%. Others mention higher figures, but most experts have a favorable forecast. At the same time, energy bills are skyrocketing in the West, causing social unrest, and governments are bending over backwards to ease the impact of the rising cost of living. The recent G7 summit, held in Germany, made clear that something is not right in this sector by focusing on an alternative sanction system: price caps.', 'The idea seeks to reduce Russian income without causing a huge disruption in the global energy markets, where Russia is a major exporter. The concept contemplates extending the application of the cap by vetoing access to Western insurance or transportation services to those who do not respect the established threshold. The administration of US President Joe Biden, which worries skyrocketing gasoline prices will sway voters at the midterm elections in November, is pushing in this direction.', 'That is one of the key playing fields. Most analysts believe that India and, above all, China, would not be willing to hurt their trade relations with the West in order to save Russia. Beijing, in particular, is so closely interconnected with Western economies that it is unlikely to risk these trade relationships for the sake of Moscow.', 'Russia is no longer publishing its import data, but the export statistics of 54 countries that accounted for 90% of all Russian purchases in 2021 show a complicated situation for the Kremlin. Not only has trade from sanctioning countries fallen by 60%; there has also been a 40% drop from countries that have not applied sanctions.', 'This means that the sanctions are considerably reducing Russia’s capacity to supply itself. There does not seem to have been any readjustment process whereby, in the absence of Western products, an equivalent supply chain from other countries has been built. Significantly, China is in line with that trend. If its imports from Russia have increased due to its larger energy purchases, its exports to Russia have shrunk in a way that is comparable to that of other countries. Beijing is not filling gaps.', 'Russia is an economy with a strong dependence on foreign countries in many sectors, particularly in technology, compared to the West, says Shagina. Import substitution, she points out, has failed, and now the only hope is to establish new supply chains through parallel imports via third countries, but they will be of inferior quality, more expensive and overall more cumbersome.', 'The US Department of Commerce maintains that global exports of microchips to Russia have fallen by 90% since the invasion. The dismal car production data could be a sign of the difficulties in accessing the necessary components. The aviation sector is also having difficulty overcoming the impact of the sanctions.', 'In the energy sector, the situation is especially problematic for Moscow. The export ban on key technologies, the voluntary stampede of leading Western companies that used to operate in the sector in Russia and the adverse market scenario, are all having an impact. An internal document from the Russian Ministry of Economy, to which Reuters had exclusive access, placed the contraction in crude oil production for this year at 17%. Official estimates for the gas sector point to a reduction of 5%.', 'Some analysts believe that this erosion of productive capacity will worsen over time, spreading throughout an economy with a limited spectrum of activities, and that it will therefore have difficulties adapting locally. This problem may also affect military manufacturing.', 'In this sector, Russia has managed to withstand a very strong blow. The ruble suffered a sharp drop, and the prospect of the exclusion of Russian entities from the SWIFT international banking circuit came very close to unleashing a wave of panic. However, skillful interventions by the Central Bank of Russia managed to stabilize the financial system; there are no longer rumors of bank stampedes, inflation is dropping and the ruble has strengthened, notes Shagina. The entity adopted a sharp rise in interest rates and other currency control measures that pushed the ruble back to its best levels against the dollar in seven years.', 'The Russian financial system has stabilized, and it is now facing a plethora of non-existential problems that impact its functioning. The lack of access to certain technologies hinders the smooth development of certain operations, although the most worrying sign for Moscow is undoubtedly the non-payment of a due date at the end of June. This occurred not because of a lack of funds – and for this reason, the Kremlin insists that it is not appropriate to call it a default – but because of the obstacles of sanctions. If repeated, it would obviously inflict serious damage on Russia in the credit markets.', 'In this sector, as in others, the struggle goes on. The US and other countries have just imposed a ban on gold imports. Western leaders are determined to hold their own for as long as it takes, the G7 said. But it is clear that, in the case of the EU, for example, in each round of sanctions – so far there have been six – reaching a consensus has been harder. This is a fight that requires both intelligence and willpower to resist adversity.']}\n",

This situation not only affects the specific countries involved, but also has global repercussions. Here is an explainer of how the sanctions are affecting the main sectors.', 'Are the energy sanctions working? The answer is no, according to Simone Tagliapietra, an analyst specializing in this matter at the Bruegel think tank, because so far Europeans have not done anything other than announcing measures. The coal ban will take effect in August; the ban on oil imports by sea, at the end of the year. According to Tagliapietra, Europe’s hesitation – its announcement of future measures instead of immediate action – is a strategic mistake. Crude oil prices have risen, China and India are importing more than before, Europeans have not reduced imports by much, and the Russians are gaining. As for gas, while the Europeans have not had the courage to do something, the Russians are taking action, restricting supplies to several European countries.', 'A study published in mid-June by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air noted that Russia made close to €93 billion from fossil fuel exports in the first 100 days after the invasion, of which some €57 billion were purchased by the European Union. European spending, Tagliapietra points out, continues, and that figure is now close to €66 billion. Bloomberg indicates that India’s energy imports from Russia between March and May increased fivefold, compared to the same period of the previous year; China has doubled that value.', 'In this context, the Kremlin has been able to mitigate the impact of the sanctions on its economy by having a fund for social protection and stimulus measures. GDP contraction forecasts had reached -12%, and now Russian leaders are beginning to point to a milder margin of -3% to -5%. Finance firm JPMorgan places the 2022 recession at around -3.5%. Others mention higher figures, but most experts have a favorable forecast. At the same time, energy bills are skyrocketing in the West, causing social unrest, and governments are bending over backwards to ease the impact of the rising cost of living. The recent G7 summit, held in Germany, made clear that something is not right in this sector by focusing on an alternative sanction system: price caps.', 'The idea seeks to reduce Russian income without causing a huge disruption in the global energy markets, where Russia is a major exporter. The concept contemplates extending the application of the cap by vetoing access to Western insurance or transportation services to those who do not respect the established threshold. The administration of US President Joe Biden, which worries skyrocketing gasoline prices will sway voters at the midterm elections in November, is pushing in this direction.', 'That is one of the key playing fields. Most analysts believe that India and, above all, China, would not be willing to hurt their trade relations with the West in order to save Russia. Beijing, in particular, is so closely interconnected with Western economies that it is unlikely to risk these trade relationships for the sake of Moscow.', 'Russia is no longer publishing its import data, but the export statistics of 54 countries that accounted for 90% of all Russian purchases in 2021 show a complicated situation for the Kremlin. Not only has trade from sanctioning countries fallen by 60%; there has also been a 40% drop from countries that have not applied sanctions.', 'This means that the sanctions are considerably reducing Russia’s capacity to supply itself. There does not seem to have been any readjustment process whereby, in the absence of Western products, an equivalent supply chain from other countries has been built. Significantly, China is in line with that trend. If its imports from Russia have increased due to its larger energy purchases, its exports to Russia have shrunk in a way that is comparable to that of other countries. Beijing is not filling gaps.', 'Russia is an economy with a strong dependence on foreign countries in many sectors, particularly in technology, compared to the West, says Shagina. Import substitution, she points out, has failed, and now the only hope is to establish new supply chains through parallel imports via third countries, but they will be of inferior quality, more expensive and overall more cumbersome.', 'The US Department of Commerce maintains that global exports of microchips to Russia have fallen by 90% since the invasion. The dismal car production data could be a sign of the difficulties in accessing the necessary components. The aviation sector is also having difficulty overcoming the impact of the sanctions.', 'In the energy sector, the situation is especially problematic for Moscow. The export ban on key technologies, the voluntary stampede of leading Western companies that used to operate in the sector in Russia and the adverse market scenario, are all having an impact. An internal document from the Russian Ministry of Economy, to which Reuters had exclusive access, placed the contraction in crude oil production for this year at 17%. Official estimates for the gas sector point to a reduction of 5%.', 'Some analysts believe that this erosion of productive capacity will worsen over time, spreading throughout an economy with a limited spectrum of activities, and that it will therefore have difficulties adapting locally. This problem may also affect military manufacturing.', 'In this sector, Russia has managed to withstand a very strong blow. The ruble suffered a sharp drop, and the prospect of the exclusion of Russian entities from the SWIFT international banking circuit came very close to unleashing a wave of panic. However, skillful interventions by the Central Bank of Russia managed to stabilize the financial system; there are no longer rumors of bank stampedes, inflation is dropping and the ruble has strengthened, notes Shagina. The entity adopted a sharp rise in interest rates and other currency control measures that pushed the ruble back to its best levels against the dollar in seven years.', 'The Russian financial system has stabilized, and it is now facing a plethora of non-existential problems that impact its functioning. The lack of access to certain technologies hinders the smooth development of certain operations, although the most worrying sign for Moscow is undoubtedly the non-payment of a due date at the end of June. This occurred not because of a lack of funds – and for this reason, the Kremlin insists that it is not appropriate to call it a default – but because of the obstacles of sanctions. If repeated, it would obviously inflict serious damage on Russia in the credit markets.', 'In this sector, as in others, the struggle goes on. The US and other countries have just imposed a ban on gold imports. Western leaders are determined to hold their own for as long as it takes, the G7 said. But it is clear that, in the case of the EU, for example, in each round of sanctions – so far there have been six – reaching a consensus has been harder. This is a fight that requires both intelligence and willpower to resist adversity.']}\n",

The tax is expected to be phased out when energy prices return to normal, said Rishi Sunak, then the chancellor of the Exchequer and today a candidate to be the next prime minister following ', '.', 'A specific tax on energy companies was one of the options that the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, had been considering to tackle the problem of surging energy prices. In ', ' with additional suggestions for mitigating the high prices, the Commission stated that “Member States can consider temporary tax measures on windfall profits and exceptionally decide to capture a part of these returns for redistribution to consumers.”', 'The banking sector is a completely different case. Although several countries (among them, the United Kingdom, France, Portugal or, more recently, Sweden) have specific taxes for the financial sector, either to return the money delivered in aid in times of crisis, or because of the risks associated with the sector’s systemic condition, only one, Hungary, has introduced a special tax on windfall profits.', 'In late May, the government of the ultraconservative Viktor Orban announced a special contribution that would have to be made not only by banks and energy companies, but also by insurers and airlines, among others. The total collection target is around €1.95 billion.', 'Another Eastern European country with a right-wing government, Poland, has been recently discussing imposing a tax on the financial sector’s windfall profits. The warning was issued last week by the former prime minister and current leader of the Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who threatened to introduce a tax of this type if financial institutions did not improve their interest rates on deposits.', 'Beyond the tax measures, the ', ' announced 10 days ago that the European Central Bank (ECB) is also trying to find a way to prevent the bloc’s banks from profiting from the ultra-cheap financing provided in recent times – especially since the outbreak of the pandemic – once interest rates start to rise.

As Yuval Noha Harari suggests in ', ', humans broke the evolutionary sequence of the law of the fittest through language and imagination. The ability to imagine realities and create credible and coherent narratives allowed them to control much larger population groups than would have been possible with the use of force. Religion and politics are palpable examples: compelling narratives that simplify complex realities and amass wide followings. The problem is that sometimes the narratives degenerate and end up taking on a life of their own. ', ' are typically the result of consistent but misleading narratives.', 'In economics there are also narratives that become dogmas far from reality. For example, that lowering taxes increases collection; that governments should behave as responsible heads of families; that debt and deficits should be objectives, not instruments of economic policy, or that central bank bond purchases always generate accelerated inflation. The narratives that are imposed determine the solutions that are ', ' and the policies that are adopted. And that is why it is important to verify them, going into the details.', 'For example, the current ', '. There is a narrative that argues that the excessive fiscal stimulus in the US, and the delayed reaction of the Federal Reserve and the rest of the central banks, are responsible for the current very high inflation. The conclusion is logical: next time the economy should be less stimulated. It is a simple and coherent conclusion, but probably incorrect. As a recent study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve shows, nearly two-thirds of current inflation in the US is due to global supply constraints, for which neither monetary nor fiscal policy is responsible. In the eurozone, where the acceleration of inflation is now coming, the weight of supply factors is even greater.', 'The chain of supply restrictions has generated a scarcity effect that has increased prices more than proportionally to the increase in demand. Combined with the general increase in the prices of all raw materials, it has contaminated the core inflation measures, giving the false impression that the economy is overheated, when what is happening is that almost all economic activities have suffered, simultaneously, an exogenous increase in costs. With wages growing much less than inflation, there can be no talk of second-round effects. Inflation expectations have risen, but only to finally be anchored on target after more than a decade of being excessively low. Everything points, for now, to a temporary increase in prices, not to a permanent increase in the rate of inflation.', 'This does not imply that interest rates should not be adjusted. The upside risk of inflation has increased, and the success of the economic policy strategy designed to combat the Covid crisis has rapidly reduced unemployment in both the US and the eurozone to historically low levels. Therefore, interest rates should also rise rapidly to more neutral levels, but without overreacting: uncertainty ', ' is huge, and the downside risk to growth stemming from production shutdowns in the second half of the year is increasing. Well-calibrated fiscal measures to support those most affected by price increases are a necessary complement to rate hikes.', 'The narratives also affect the debate on risk premiums in the eurozone. There is a narrative that defends that if the ECB creates a risk premium management instrument, it will be putting the fiscal discipline of the eurozone at risk. Simple and consistent conclusion, but also probably wrong. A little historical perspective helps. The current risk premiums, high and procyclical, appeared when the eurozone committed its original sin: the decision not to mutualize the resolution of its banking crisis, and to make aid programs conditional on debt restructuring.

As Yuval Noha Harari suggests in ', ', humans broke the evolutionary sequence of the law of the fittest through language and imagination. The ability to imagine realities and create credible and coherent narratives allowed them to control much larger population groups than would have been possible with the use of force. Religion and politics are palpable examples: compelling narratives that simplify complex realities and amass wide followings. The problem is that sometimes the narratives degenerate and end up taking on a life of their own. ', ' are typically the result of consistent but misleading narratives.', 'In economics there are also narratives that become dogmas far from reality. For example, that lowering taxes increases collection; that governments should behave as responsible heads of families; that debt and deficits should be objectives, not instruments of economic policy, or that central bank bond purchases always generate accelerated inflation. The narratives that are imposed determine the solutions that are ', ' and the policies that are adopted. And that is why it is important to verify them, going into the details.', 'For example, the current ', '. There is a narrative that argues that the excessive fiscal stimulus in the US, and the delayed reaction of the Federal Reserve and the rest of the central banks, are responsible for the current very high inflation. The conclusion is logical: next time the economy should be less stimulated. It is a simple and coherent conclusion, but probably incorrect. As a recent study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve shows, nearly two-thirds of current inflation in the US is due to global supply constraints, for which neither monetary nor fiscal policy is responsible. In the eurozone, where the acceleration of inflation is now coming, the weight of supply factors is even greater.', 'The chain of supply restrictions has generated a scarcity effect that has increased prices more than proportionally to the increase in demand. Combined with the general increase in the prices of all raw materials, it has contaminated the core inflation measures, giving the false impression that the economy is overheated, when what is happening is that almost all economic activities have suffered, simultaneously, an exogenous increase in costs. With wages growing much less than inflation, there can be no talk of second-round effects. Inflation expectations have risen, but only to finally be anchored on target after more than a decade of being excessively low. Everything points, for now, to a temporary increase in prices, not to a permanent increase in the rate of inflation.', 'This does not imply that interest rates should not be adjusted. The upside risk of inflation has increased, and the success of the economic policy strategy designed to combat the Covid crisis has rapidly reduced unemployment in both the US and the eurozone to historically low levels. Therefore, interest rates should also rise rapidly to more neutral levels, but without overreacting: uncertainty ', ' is huge, and the downside risk to growth stemming from production shutdowns in the second half of the year is increasing. Well-calibrated fiscal measures to support those most affected by price increases are a necessary complement to rate hikes.', 'The narratives also affect the debate on risk premiums in the eurozone. There is a narrative that defends that if the ECB creates a risk premium management instrument, it will be putting the fiscal discipline of the eurozone at risk. Simple and consistent conclusion, but also probably wrong. A little historical perspective helps. The current risk premiums, high and procyclical, appeared when the eurozone committed its original sin: the decision not to mutualize the resolution of its banking crisis, and to make aid programs conditional on debt restructuring. This broke the implicit solidarity of a monetary union and changed the nature of peripheral countries’ bonds, which came to be considered risky assets, limiting their investment universe. The lack of institutional support led to excessive reductions in ', ', and the ECB’s decision to use ', ' in its bond purchase and collateral eligibility decisions amplified and perpetuated risk premiums. The ECB is the central bank of each and every one of the countries in the eurozone, and therefore it should accept the bonds of all its countries – just as the rest of the central banks do.', 'The empirical evidence is stubborn with narratives.

At the time, Martinez had just lost €2,000 in the QubitLife ', ', and he was reluctant to invest more money in seemingly promising projects. But he invested €300 in JuicyFields. Just 108 days later, he received €450. JuicyFields was a company in the cannabis sector. Its investors bought “plants,” the company said, and at the end of the term they collected incredible profits from their harvest, about 50% of their investment. JuicyFields was supposedly a system to collectively microfinance ', '.', 'Martinez invested another €2,000. “We all cashed in again,” he remembers. The trap was set, and over the course of the year the Valencian saw things that further convinced him: the company was featured on a Mexican CNN program when it participated in that country’s cannabis fair; it opened an office in Valencia’s Town Hall square; Martínez came across a truck with the company’s logo on the highway near Alicante; and he saw them display two Lamborghinis at a big fair in Barcelona as well.', 'With all this in mind, in January 2022 Martinez went all in and invested €18,000. “You are stressed out all the time,” he says. But in April, he received a return on his investment of €27,000. Bingo! Could it really be that easy to make money? “A group of investors from Valencia’s Polytechnic University had invested, a lot of people had done it, and it gave the whole thing a little more gravitas,” he explains.', 'But despite the investment’s gradual success, Martínez still didn’t quite believe it. Then, in the spring, videos began to appear on YouTube that talked about a possible pyramid scheme. Still, the temptation of easy money remained. He invested another €5,500.', 'He would never see that money again. JuicyFields’ promise began to fade on July 11 when an email written in strange Spanish announced an employee strike. The email said, “All members are asked to not promote or advertise JuicyFields anymore in any way.” It went on to say that “[o]ur organization is very strong, and it is time for the legal and cultivation departments to demonstrate their strength.” Thousands of “e-cultivators” (as the company called investors) got a bad feeling. “It was a surprise, I had a week left to go before getting paid,” says Martinez. He lost that €5,500, but still came out ahead when taking all his JuicyFields trades into account. But he had shared his success story with friends, and some had invested €14,000 in the latest round of investments. “All told, we lost €50,000 between us,” he estimates.', 'Several law firms immediately began filing class action lawsuits. EL PAÍS has seen the figures that the two law firms are handling. Both are flooded with messages. “About 6,000 people have contacted us by email,” estimates the lawyer Emilia Zaballos. “I have six people opening emails and there are still 5,300 that haven’t been read yet,” she adds. There are already some 700 people participating in the lawsuit she is filing. The Martínez-Blanco law firm’s lawsuit currently involves more than 1,400 people. And these are not the only law firms that are working on this case.', 'Both lawyers suggest that the scam has affected many more people and that the amount of money lost probably exceeds €10 million. According to company data, Spain had the second most investors behind Germany and ahead of France and Portugal. There are unconfirmed reports of couples who invested the maximum amount of €180,000.', '“It is one of the most incredible cases I have ever seen,” Zaballos says. “People buying plants and investing all of their savings without getting properly informed first is one of the craziest stories I’ve ever heard in my 34 years of practice. Of all the big scams, this one really amazes me,” she says.', 'Emilio Collazo, of the Crypto Era YouTube channel, has been investigating the case for several weeks; he has two friends who lost €90,000. “The day the strike email arrived, they shut down money withdrawals,” he explains. “Then I started looking at the cryptocurrency record. I saw that there was only cash coming in, but I also found two or three instances of cash going out. That really set off alarm bells for me,” he recalls.', 'Collazo found a total of “hundreds of millions spread over seven or eight wallets [portfolios].” He also notes that there was something strange about the transactions: “They used a technique meant to confuse people like me who [actually] look. It is a method in which thousands of small transactions are done to cover up money withdrawals. I am certain that someone withdrew money when it could not be withdrawn. The techniques are those that a criminal uses to throw people off their scent,” he says. In this week’s latest video, Collazo spoke with JuicyFields’s former CEO, a shady character named Alan Glanse, who says he ', ' and was paid €10,000 a month. Apparently, Glanse encouraged his family and friends to invest hundreds of thousands of euros in the company; they lost that money too. Glanse also confirmed that he will cooperate with the authorities. “He gave the impression of someone who wants to make it seem like he has no knowledge of the situation, who is not very aware, but actually has information that could be the key to solving the case,” Collazo opined.', 'A pyramid scheme relies on using the money that comes in from new investors to pay the older ones. As long as there is fresh money, the scheme can grow. According to David Martinez, one of JuicyFields’s hypothetical advantages was that it did not require investors to bring in new dupes. The incredible financial results of investing in the company seemed to offer enough inducement', 'The problem with ', ' is that investors can still come out ahead if they withdraw the money in a timely fashion, as happened in Martinez’s case. But in the spring, several YouTube channels were already warning that this company seemed like a scam. Mere months earlier, articles had appeared in the international press and the Spanish media about this cannabis investment system’s apparent benefits. It is not easy to resist the trap.', 'In order to recover the money, or at least some of it, time is of the essence. It is crucial to act quickly to block the alleged offenders’ accounts right away. The company has accounts in Cyprus and Estonia, at least. “It’s going to be a difficult road, I don’t want to make it seem like it will be easy,” lawyer Norberto Martinez Blanco warns. “It is a two-fold challenge: the speed of legal action and blocking accounts as soon as possible,” he explains.', 'The company originated in Germany, but later it moved to the Netherlands and Switzerland, according to ', ', which mentions a story circulating on the internet that claims Russian citizens own the company. In his interview with Collazo, Glanse confirmed that Russians led the company, though he does not attach much importance to that fact, because “Spaniards can also belong to the mafia.” Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) added JuicyFields to a very long list of companies that “do not have any authorization and are not registered with the CNMV for the purpose of carrying out any type of fundraising activity or providing any service of a financial nature.” The CNMV itself added that “the list is not exhaustive and mainly derives from search and analysis of the internet and social networks.” On June 3, the German authorities banned JuicyFields from “offering capital investments in the form of opportunities.”', 'On July 19, the official JuicyFields account sent its last email. It was written in English, and the subject line read “Volunteers needed.” The text seemed to be a joke about the affected individuals recouping their money. The email urged customers to “[u]se the following email addresses to submit your story, speak your mind, send collateral for an emergency refund, or embark on a long road of endless conversations with our lawyers.” One of the accounts was ', '. It went on to say, “The guys wearing black hoods and the people running in the streets can also send their proposals indicating the amount of hashish and flowers they can sell each month to ', '. After all, it’s nice to be part of a big Italian-Russian-Colombian family.”']}\n",

The trap was set, and over the course of the year the Valencian saw things that further convinced him: the company was featured on a Mexican CNN program when it participated in that country’s cannabis fair; it opened an office in Valencia’s Town Hall square; Martínez came across a truck with the company’s logo on the highway near Alicante; and he saw them display two Lamborghinis at a big fair in Barcelona as well.', 'With all this in mind, in January 2022 Martinez went all in and invested €18,000. “You are stressed out all the time,” he says. But in April, he received a return on his investment of €27,000. Bingo! Could it really be that easy to make money? “A group of investors from Valencia’s Polytechnic University had invested, a lot of people had done it, and it gave the whole thing a little more gravitas,” he explains.', 'But despite the investment’s gradual success, Martínez still didn’t quite believe it. Then, in the spring, videos began to appear on YouTube that talked about a possible pyramid scheme. Still, the temptation of easy money remained. He invested another €5,500.', 'He would never see that money again. JuicyFields’ promise began to fade on July 11 when an email written in strange Spanish announced an employee strike. The email said, “All members are asked to not promote or advertise JuicyFields anymore in any way.” It went on to say that “[o]ur organization is very strong, and it is time for the legal and cultivation departments to demonstrate their strength.” Thousands of “e-cultivators” (as the company called investors) got a bad feeling. “It was a surprise, I had a week left to go before getting paid,” says Martinez. He lost that €5,500, but still came out ahead when taking all his JuicyFields trades into account. But he had shared his success story with friends, and some had invested €14,000 in the latest round of investments. “All told, we lost €50,000 between us,” he estimates.', 'Several law firms immediately began filing class action lawsuits. EL PAÍS has seen the figures that the two law firms are handling. Both are flooded with messages. “About 6,000 people have contacted us by email,” estimates the lawyer Emilia Zaballos. “I have six people opening emails and there are still 5,300 that haven’t been read yet,” she adds. There are already some 700 people participating in the lawsuit she is filing. The Martínez-Blanco law firm’s lawsuit currently involves more than 1,400 people. And these are not the only law firms that are working on this case.', 'Both lawyers suggest that the scam has affected many more people and that the amount of money lost probably exceeds €10 million. According to company data, Spain had the second most investors behind Germany and ahead of France and Portugal. There are unconfirmed reports of couples who invested the maximum amount of €180,000.', '“It is one of the most incredible cases I have ever seen,” Zaballos says. “People buying plants and investing all of their savings without getting properly informed first is one of the craziest stories I’ve ever heard in my 34 years of practice. Of all the big scams, this one really amazes me,” she says.', 'Emilio Collazo, of the Crypto Era YouTube channel, has been investigating the case for several weeks; he has two friends who lost €90,000. “The day the strike email arrived, they shut down money withdrawals,” he explains. “Then I started looking at the cryptocurrency record. I saw that there was only cash coming in, but I also found two or three instances of cash going out. That really set off alarm bells for me,” he recalls.', 'Collazo found a total of “hundreds of millions spread over seven or eight wallets [portfolios].” He also notes that there was something strange about the transactions: “They used a technique meant to confuse people like me who [actually] look. It is a method in which thousands of small transactions are done to cover up money withdrawals. I am certain that someone withdrew money when it could not be withdrawn. The techniques are those that a criminal uses to throw people off their scent,” he says. In this week’s latest video, Collazo spoke with JuicyFields’s former CEO, a shady character named Alan Glanse, who says he ', ' and was paid €10,000 a month. Apparently, Glanse encouraged his family and friends to invest hundreds of thousands of euros in the company; they lost that money too. Glanse also confirmed that he will cooperate with the authorities. “He gave the impression of someone who wants to make it seem like he has no knowledge of the situation, who is not very aware, but actually has information that could be the key to solving the case,” Collazo opined.', 'A pyramid scheme relies on using the money that comes in from new investors to pay the older ones. As long as there is fresh money, the scheme can grow. According to David Martinez, one of JuicyFields’s hypothetical advantages was that it did not require investors to bring in new dupes. The incredible financial results of investing in the company seemed to offer enough inducement', 'The problem with ', ' is that investors can still come out ahead if they withdraw the money in a timely fashion, as happened in Martinez’s case. But in the spring, several YouTube channels were already warning that this company seemed like a scam. Mere months earlier, articles had appeared in the international press and the Spanish media about this cannabis investment system’s apparent benefits. It is not easy to resist the trap.', 'In order to recover the money, or at least some of it, time is of the essence. It is crucial to act quickly to block the alleged offenders’ accounts right away. The company has accounts in Cyprus and Estonia, at least. “It’s going to be a difficult road, I don’t want to make it seem like it will be easy,” lawyer Norberto Martinez Blanco warns. “It is a two-fold challenge: the speed of legal action and blocking accounts as soon as possible,” he explains.', 'The company originated in Germany, but later it moved to the Netherlands and Switzerland, according to ', ', which mentions a story circulating on the internet that claims Russian citizens own the company. In his interview with Collazo, Glanse confirmed that Russians led the company, though he does not attach much importance to that fact, because “Spaniards can also belong to the mafia.” Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) added JuicyFields to a very long list of companies that “do not have any authorization and are not registered with the CNMV for the purpose of carrying out any type of fundraising activity or providing any service of a financial nature.” The CNMV itself added that “the list is not exhaustive and mainly derives from search and analysis of the internet and social networks.” On June 3, the German authorities banned JuicyFields from “offering capital investments in the form of opportunities.”', 'On July 19, the official JuicyFields account sent its last email. It was written in English, and the subject line read “Volunteers needed.” The text seemed to be a joke about the affected individuals recouping their money. The email urged customers to “[u]se the following email addresses to submit your story, speak your mind, send collateral for an emergency refund, or embark on a long road of endless conversations with our lawyers.” One of the accounts was ', '. It went on to say, “The guys wearing black hoods and the people running in the streets can also send their proposals indicating the amount of hashish and flowers they can sell each month to ', '. After all, it’s nice to be part of a big Italian-Russian-Colombian family.”']}\n",

These days, that makes him the most popular artist on the globe. “He keeps breaking records and climbing skyward, reaching a place reserved for rare, once-in-a-lifetime stars,” wrote ', ' this week, joining dozens of other publications recognizing that, for the first time in history, the number one luminary in world pop is a Latino artist.', 'It’s hard to deny. The musician from Puerto Rico just filled New York’s Yankee Stadium for two nights in a row, selling 100,000 tickets. During one of those concerts, he received the MTV VMA Award for Artist of the Year, becoming its first non-English speaking winner. “I believed from the beginning that I could become great, that I could become one of the biggest stars in the world without having to change my culture, my language, my jargon. I am Benito Antonio Martínez, from Puerto Rico to the whole world,” he said in his acceptance speech.', 'To ensure that the VMAs would be unforgettable, the boy who in 2016 worked as a supermarket bagger in Vega Baja, a city half-an-hour from San Juan, kissed one of his male dancers on the mouth onstage during his performance. After dressing in skirts and painting his nails, he publicly broke another taboo in the world of urban music. Pablito Wilson, author of ', ', explains that the genre is generally masculine and conservative. “It is impossible to know why he did it. A kiss has the meaning you want to give it,” says the Argentine journalist. “A ', ' man knows that kissing a male dancer means something important to the LGBTI community. It will be a gesture of solidarity, and it will not take away his manhood. It is also possible that he is discovering bisexuality. What surprises me is that it’s such a scandal. That discussion seems crazy to me,” he says.', 'Wilson is clear about what makes Bad Bunny stand out. “We are in an age where honesty is rewarded and anything perceived as dishonest is punished. That comes with the Youtubers and the TikTok generation. Bad Bunny had super misogynistic lyrics. He was an irresponsible teenager, as many of us were at the time. And he has allowed himself to be shaped, he has become a more responsible person. I think he was greatly nurtured by his relationship with Gabriela,” he explains.', 'Gabriela Berlingeri is the rapper’s only publicly known partner since 2017. According to him, Berlingeri helped him become aware of gender issues, to the point that, after winning for Best Latin Artist at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards, the musician used his speech to launch a message in Spanish against sexist violence on American television. “I want to dedicate this award to all women around the world, especially to Latin women and women from Puerto Rico. Without you, neither music nor ', ' would exist, so enough of sexist violence against women, we are going to educate now in the present for a better future, “said the Puerto Rican after performing his hit “Yo Perreo Sola.”', '“He learned about women’s concerns from Gabriela,” continues Wilson. “He knew how to listen, and that brought him to take up certain causes. I think he is a very genuine guy. He adds to all that the fact that he produces. Since he was 12 years old, he has produced a lot of music. He started on SoundCloud and was followed by DJs and producers for a long time. By the time his songs ‘Diles’ and ‘Soy el Peor’ became hits, he was already known in the scene. Image and marketing are also a factor, which doesn’t mean he’s dishonest.

These days, that makes him the most popular artist on the globe. “He keeps breaking records and climbing skyward, reaching a place reserved for rare, once-in-a-lifetime stars,” wrote ', ' this week, joining dozens of other publications recognizing that, for the first time in history, the number one luminary in world pop is a Latino artist.', 'It’s hard to deny. The musician from Puerto Rico just filled New York’s Yankee Stadium for two nights in a row, selling 100,000 tickets. During one of those concerts, he received the MTV VMA Award for Artist of the Year, becoming its first non-English speaking winner. “I believed from the beginning that I could become great, that I could become one of the biggest stars in the world without having to change my culture, my language, my jargon. I am Benito Antonio Martínez, from Puerto Rico to the whole world,” he said in his acceptance speech.', 'To ensure that the VMAs would be unforgettable, the boy who in 2016 worked as a supermarket bagger in Vega Baja, a city half-an-hour from San Juan, kissed one of his male dancers on the mouth onstage during his performance. After dressing in skirts and painting his nails, he publicly broke another taboo in the world of urban music. Pablito Wilson, author of ', ', explains that the genre is generally masculine and conservative. “It is impossible to know why he did it. A kiss has the meaning you want to give it,” says the Argentine journalist. “A ', ' man knows that kissing a male dancer means something important to the LGBTI community. It will be a gesture of solidarity, and it will not take away his manhood. It is also possible that he is discovering bisexuality. What surprises me is that it’s such a scandal. That discussion seems crazy to me,” he says.', 'Wilson is clear about what makes Bad Bunny stand out. “We are in an age where honesty is rewarded and anything perceived as dishonest is punished. That comes with the Youtubers and the TikTok generation. Bad Bunny had super misogynistic lyrics. He was an irresponsible teenager, as many of us were at the time. And he has allowed himself to be shaped, he has become a more responsible person. I think he was greatly nurtured by his relationship with Gabriela,” he explains.', 'Gabriela Berlingeri is the rapper’s only publicly known partner since 2017. According to him, Berlingeri helped him become aware of gender issues, to the point that, after winning for Best Latin Artist at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards, the musician used his speech to launch a message in Spanish against sexist violence on American television. “I want to dedicate this award to all women around the world, especially to Latin women and women from Puerto Rico. Without you, neither music nor ', ' would exist, so enough of sexist violence against women, we are going to educate now in the present for a better future, “said the Puerto Rican after performing his hit “Yo Perreo Sola.”', '“He learned about women’s concerns from Gabriela,” continues Wilson. “He knew how to listen, and that brought him to take up certain causes. I think he is a very genuine guy. He adds to all that the fact that he produces. Since he was 12 years old, he has produced a lot of music. He started on SoundCloud and was followed by DJs and producers for a long time. By the time his songs ‘Diles’ and ‘Soy el Peor’ became hits, he was already known in the scene. Image and marketing are also a factor, which doesn’t mean he’s dishonest.

She took it to the vestry and left it there as usual for him to drink while he was dressing. A few minutes later, she peeked into the vestry and noticed that the cup of coffee was untouched. The nun opened the door to the pope’s bedroom and found him sitting up in bed, wearing his eyeglasses. The light was still on from the night before, and some papers he had been reading (some say it was ', ', a 15th-century devotional) were strewn about.', 'No one was prepared for the pope’s untimely death, nor for the news that a woman had entered a pope’s private quarters and found his corpse – imagine the rumors. But the ensuing Vatican response was badly botched – it issued a series of communications with conflicting information, changed its story several times, and refused to authorize an autopsy of Luciani, who served one of the most short-lived papal reigns in the ', '. It’s a story that inspired novels, essays and movies for several decades, and resurfaced again with the announcement of the beatification of Pope John Paul I, miracle included. John Paul I is the fifth pontiff of the 20th century (Pius X, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul II) to be beatified, the last step before sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.', 'Born in 1912, in Canale d’Agordo (northeastern Italy), Luciano’s death was a complete surprise, as was his election to the papacy. As he entered the papal conclave on August 26, 1978, there was no indication that he was the frontrunner. After only four votes, he emerged from the conclave as pope, converted by the Holy Spirit and an earthly disagreement about the other two leading candidates. Although it lasted only 33 days, his brief pontificate made lasting reforms to the Vatican’s financial management practices. His death, presumably due to a heart attack, was quickly engulfed in rumors and legends, and inspired a long list of movies and books that his postulators (beatification nominating team) characterize as fake news.', 'The truth is that the 66-year-old Luciani, the most recent Italian-born pope, was not feeling well that night. Diego Lorenzi, his private secretary, suggested calling a doctor, but the pope preferred not to bother. “Before retiring for the night, he met with the Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Colombo, to talk about filling the post Luciani had just vacated in Venice. They had a long conversation and disagreed about whom to appoint. He then retired to his private quarters, and little else is known. He suffered a heart attack so severe that he didn’t even have time to press the bell next to the bed and ring for help,” says Giovanni Maria Vian, a church historian and former editor of ', ', the daily Vatican City newspaper. Vian is the principal author of', '. ', ' (2022), an illustrated biography of Luciani with contributions from other authors such as Juan Manuel de Prada.', 'The legend of John Paul I, who chose his name in honor of his two predecessors, is the product of a brief papacy and stormy year during which three different popes (Paul VI, John Paul I and John Paul II) appeared on the famous Vatican Palace balcony. It was a turbulent time for Italy. Former prime minister Aldo Moro had been kidnapped and assassinated three months earlier, and the country was being wracked by political turmoil, mafia crime and internecine war in the Italian secret services. According to Prada, the Vatican was not spared. “The fact that he died a month after being elected is extraordinary. From a supernatural perspective it leads to reflection, and if you are a believer, you wonder why God allowed the Vicar of Christ to die. But from an earthly perspective, it’s impossible not to speculate that his death was caused by dark forces. It was a very turbulent period in the history of the Church and the world,” says Prada.', 'Prada recalls the spate of fanciful books that came out after Luciani’s death – ', ' by Maurice Serral and Max Savigny (1983), and ', '(2011) by Vladimir Volkoff. In', ', the top Russian Orthodox prelate in Soviet-era Leningrad, dies in Luciani’s arms while in Rome for the installation of Pope John Paul I. Only 49 years old, the strange circumstances surrounding the death of Metropolitan Nikodim (secular name Boris Georgiyevich Rotov) added to all the', ' swirling around the pontiff.', 'Luciani was a linchpin between two worlds, two eras. But every transition to a new era opens the door for powerful storms to develop. Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci sounded a warning at the beginning of the 20th century. “The old world is dying, the new is slow to appear. And in that chiaroscuro, monsters emerge.” Three such “monsters” emerged shortly after Luciani’s papacy. Roberto Calvi, chairman of the bankrupt Banco Ambrosiano, dubbed “God’s Banker” for his close association with the Holy See, was found dead from an apparent suicide in London. American archbishop Paul Marcinkus, then president of the Vatican Bank, became embroiled in a huge financial scandal due to the Vatican Bank’s large stake in the failed Banco Ambrosiano. Marcinkus was implicated in several major scandals, and was known for his practical management approach: “The Church is not governed with Hail Marys.” Then there is Italian financier, Licio Gelli, who was revealed in 1981 as being the Venerable Master of the clandestine masonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2). A character named Lico Lucchesi in ', ' was based on Gelli. That film by ', 'is one of the best accounts of this period of transition in the Church (and the world), during which the new pope strives to restore order to the Vatican’s finances.

She took it to the vestry and left it there as usual for him to drink while he was dressing. A few minutes later, she peeked into the vestry and noticed that the cup of coffee was untouched. The nun opened the door to the pope’s bedroom and found him sitting up in bed, wearing his eyeglasses. The light was still on from the night before, and some papers he had been reading (some say it was ', ', a 15th-century devotional) were strewn about.', 'No one was prepared for the pope’s untimely death, nor for the news that a woman had entered a pope’s private quarters and found his corpse – imagine the rumors. But the ensuing Vatican response was badly botched – it issued a series of communications with conflicting information, changed its story several times, and refused to authorize an autopsy of Luciani, who served one of the most short-lived papal reigns in the ', '. It’s a story that inspired novels, essays and movies for several decades, and resurfaced again with the announcement of the beatification of Pope John Paul I, miracle included. John Paul I is the fifth pontiff of the 20th century (Pius X, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul II) to be beatified, the last step before sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.', 'Born in 1912, in Canale d’Agordo (northeastern Italy), Luciano’s death was a complete surprise, as was his election to the papacy. As he entered the papal conclave on August 26, 1978, there was no indication that he was the frontrunner. After only four votes, he emerged from the conclave as pope, converted by the Holy Spirit and an earthly disagreement about the other two leading candidates. Although it lasted only 33 days, his brief pontificate made lasting reforms to the Vatican’s financial management practices. His death, presumably due to a heart attack, was quickly engulfed in rumors and legends, and inspired a long list of movies and books that his postulators (beatification nominating team) characterize as fake news.', 'The truth is that the 66-year-old Luciani, the most recent Italian-born pope, was not feeling well that night. Diego Lorenzi, his private secretary, suggested calling a doctor, but the pope preferred not to bother. “Before retiring for the night, he met with the Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Colombo, to talk about filling the post Luciani had just vacated in Venice. They had a long conversation and disagreed about whom to appoint. He then retired to his private quarters, and little else is known. He suffered a heart attack so severe that he didn’t even have time to press the bell next to the bed and ring for help,” says Giovanni Maria Vian, a church historian and former editor of ', ', the daily Vatican City newspaper. Vian is the principal author of', '. ', ' (2022), an illustrated biography of Luciani with contributions from other authors such as Juan Manuel de Prada.', 'The legend of John Paul I, who chose his name in honor of his two predecessors, is the product of a brief papacy and stormy year during which three different popes (Paul VI, John Paul I and John Paul II) appeared on the famous Vatican Palace balcony. It was a turbulent time for Italy. Former prime minister Aldo Moro had been kidnapped and assassinated three months earlier, and the country was being wracked by political turmoil, mafia crime and internecine war in the Italian secret services. According to Prada, the Vatican was not spared. “The fact that he died a month after being elected is extraordinary. From a supernatural perspective it leads to reflection, and if you are a believer, you wonder why God allowed the Vicar of Christ to die. But from an earthly perspective, it’s impossible not to speculate that his death was caused by dark forces. It was a very turbulent period in the history of the Church and the world,” says Prada.', 'Prada recalls the spate of fanciful books that came out after Luciani’s death – ', ' by Maurice Serral and Max Savigny (1983), and ', '(2011) by Vladimir Volkoff. In', ', the top Russian Orthodox prelate in Soviet-era Leningrad, dies in Luciani’s arms while in Rome for the installation of Pope John Paul I.

But every transition to a new era opens the door for powerful storms to develop. Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci sounded a warning at the beginning of the 20th century. “The old world is dying, the new is slow to appear. And in that chiaroscuro, monsters emerge.” Three such “monsters” emerged shortly after Luciani’s papacy. Roberto Calvi, chairman of the bankrupt Banco Ambrosiano, dubbed “God’s Banker” for his close association with the Holy See, was found dead from an apparent suicide in London. American archbishop Paul Marcinkus, then president of the Vatican Bank, became embroiled in a huge financial scandal due to the Vatican Bank’s large stake in the failed Banco Ambrosiano. Marcinkus was implicated in several major scandals, and was known for his practical management approach: “The Church is not governed with Hail Marys.” Then there is Italian financier, Licio Gelli, who was revealed in 1981 as being the Venerable Master of the clandestine masonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2). A character named Lico Lucchesi in ', ' was based on Gelli. That film by ', 'is one of the best accounts of this period of transition in the Church (and the world), during which the new pope strives to restore order to the Vatican’s finances.

Four weeks later, the results arrived: 52% Scandinavian, 26% Iberian, 18% Italian and 4% Northern European. “I wasn’t expecting the 18% Italian,” he says. “I had been told I had French ancestors.”', 'The tests start at around $50 and compare an individual’s genome with a “reference” set of people from different populations, says Gencove CEO, Joseph Pickrell. “If a company has a database of people from Basque country and southern Spain, it compares your genome to those individuals to determine if you are more closely related to one group than the other. For example, it might conclude that your ancestry is more Basque than southern Spanish.”', 'In addition to identifying the geographic regions a person comes from, they can also indicate a person’s genetic traits. “Hair color, curly or straight hair, eye color,” says Ana Basterrechea Salido, a 26-year-old who took the test offered by 23andMe. She also took the test because she wanted to know more about her ancestors: “I’m always asking my grandparents about them. I’ve collected some photos, and I’m creating a family tree.”', 'DNA matching can help people ', ', even distant ones like fourth or fifth cousins, according to the study published in ', '. This information can be particularly useful for people with ', ', such as adoptees and descendants of forced migrants.', 'But these tests can also reveal information that some people would rather not know. ', ', a law professor at Vanderbilt University (Tennessee, US), said, “For example, [they may learn] that they are from a different racial group than they thought, or that they have half-brothers or sisters they didn’t know about, suggesting that they are a product of a sperm bank, or that one of their parents had an affair or a previous marriage.”', 'Some people have discovered facts about their family history that were kept secret for fear of discrimination, says Pickrell. “In fact, I’m one of them.” The Gencove CEO discovered that one of his great-grandfathers was a Polish Ashkenazi Jew who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. An even more astonishing case was ', 'a few years ago. Alice Collins Plebuch, an American who took a DNA ancestry test in 2012, found out that her genetic heritage was not 100% Irish, as she thought. Her results revealed a mix of European, Middle Eastern and Eastern European Jewish genes. After doing some genealogical research on her own, she learned that her father was not the biological son of his parents – as an infant, he had been sent home from the hospital with the wrong family.', 'In theory, some tests can also detect certain inherited health conditions, such as sickle cell anemia (a disorder of the red blood cells) and cystic fibrosis (one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young people). The tests claim that they can identify clusters of genes linked to an increased risk of developing heart disease or certain types of cancer. But, according to a ', ' these tests cannot indicate with certainty whether someone will experience health problems. “At-home tests do not screen for every possible risky gene, and results may not always be accurate,” the authors note.', 'What are the implications of private companies having your genetic data? Each company has its own policy on how it handles this data. Basterrechea did inquire about what 23andMe could do with her data, but Gulliksen didn’t pay much attention to this issue. “I’m pretty trusting, and I’m not too worried about what they might do with my genetic data. But I understand that others might have that concern,” he says.', 'Some companies don’t require a person’s explicit consent to share data with pharmaceutical companies and law enforcement agencies. Slogobin claims that some companies often sell DNA profiles and personal information for medical and other research purposes. In 2018, 23andMe struck a ', ' with GlaxoSmithKline, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. “While these DNA profiles are usually de-identified, it’s often possible to re-identify a person,” says Slogobin. When that happens, personal health issues could be revealed to third parties.', 'Law enforcement agencies have also used genetic databases to solve crimes. ', ' that it provided customer data to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Genetic information can help identify or exclude criminal suspects, and was used to catch one of the most savage serial killers of the 1970s in the United States. Between 1976 and 1986, a stranger terrorized California, murdering 13 people and raping 50 women. Ex-cop Joseph James DeAngelo, Jr. – the Golden State Killer – was found guilty on all charges in 2020, two years after he was identified with information from a private DNA database.']}\n",

Then, they shoot each other signals that direct the reconstruction of the missing body part from the stump, growing an exact replicate.', 'Tanaka recently discovered how some crucial signals help with the arrangement of cells and tissues from what looks like a confused jumble.', 'She discovered that cells in the regenerating tissue that come from the thumb side of the limb start to produce different signals than cells from the pinky-finger side.', '“The thumb side produces FGF-8 [fibroblast growth factor], and this tells the pinky-side cells that they need to produce Sonic Hedgehog,” said Tanaka.', 'Named in honor of the famous Sonic the Hedgehog videogame character, the Sonic Hedgehog signalling molecule (SHH) is crucial to embryonic development in animals and humans.', 'Another signal molecule, also found in people, is FGF-8, which also has a role in tissue repair and development.', 'Together, FGF-8 and SHH stoke pro-growth conditions inside the damaged limb and help direct the jumble of cells in the blastema.', '“You need cells from the pinky and thumb side of the limb to come into this blastema, and so you have all the cell types that you need to rebuild,” said Prof Tanaka.', 'Another scientist intrigued by axolotls is cell biologist Dr Sandra Edwards at TU Dresden. She became interested in salamanders after attending a research course in the US during her PhD in Chile, redirecting her career.', 'She applied to join the lab of Tatiana Sandoval-Guzmán, an eminent researcher of axolotl limb repair at the Centre for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD).', '“The more I heard about salamanders, the more I became fascinated,” recalled Edwards, who hopes her research can one day go to help patients.', 'In the ', ', the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) fellow Dr Edwards, studies how differences in tension within tissues may influence the repair and help the animal turn what seems like cellular chaos into a perfectly functioning limb.', 'She became intrigued with the fact that limb regrowth takes a similar amount of time, regardless of the amount of tissue being replaced. This means limbs must grow faster when more tissue is removed.', '“My hypothesis is that tension or stiffness is higher in tissues that grow slower,” she said.', 'It may seem surprising, but the mechanics and rigidity of tissues can influence their development and regeneration as well as pathologies like cancer.', 'There is a web-like network called the cytoskeleton inside cells. This can sense external pressures when compressed, which opens entry points (akin to postal boxes) to the nucleus of a cell, allowing molecular messages to flow in and turn genes on and off.', '“In our system, we have observed that during limb generation in the axolotl, tissues that are closer to the body are softer and grows faster than tissues that are further away from the body on the end of a limb, for example, which are stiffer.”', 'Knowledge about tissue stiffness could help injured patients. While conceivably such patients might be treated with stem cells delivered in a matrix, the pressures within the patient’s tissues may prove important.', '‘It may be that the tissues and their cells on different parts of the body behave differently, even within the same structure such as the arm, such as upper and lower arm, said Edwards. Therefore, in regenerative medicine, where cell-containing matrixes are transplanted into large wounds, such scaffolds may need to be different, depending on where in the body they will be placed.', 'Though Tanaka spends most days studying the molecular mechanics of axolotl repair, she too foresees future benefits to injured patients. But salamanders and mammals develop differently.', 'In mammals, like ourselves, when we first develop an arm, this happens at a tiny scale in an embryo. The salamander is different. It seems to contain a bud capable of developing into a large adult arm.', '“We are not going to be able to ask a human cell to do this, because it’s wired to work at tiny scales,” said Tanaka. “But we might be able to produce a group of human stem cells that regenerate like an axolotl.”', 'This could be extremely beneficial, for example, to people who suffer extensive burn wounds. Repair of this skin currently does not give a person sweat glands, hair follicles and other cell types, but lessons from the salamander could make this possible.', '‘Resetting these fibroblasts – which the axolotl does – could be quite relevant to better healing in very large wounds, such as from burns,’ Prof Tanaka said.']}\n",

I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world. During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which The Queen was so widely held,” he continued.', 'Unlike his mother, who kept her opinions about the United Kingdom’s polemical issues a mystery until her death, Charles of England takes the throne as an open book to the British people. Dozens of years waiting for his turn to arrive, and a restless character, caused the Prince of Wales to find himself in trouble more than necessary. But he also showed the citizenry that, in certain issues, like the fight against climate change or the need to save urban centers from decay, he was a man in touch with the times, and often ahead of his peers.', 'Walter Bagehot, the legendary editor of ', ' who wrote the essay about English government most consulted by the United Kingdom’s monarchs, observed that “the only fit material for a constitutional king is a prince who begins early to reign.” Charles, at 73 years old, has become an anomaly among monarchs of the 21st century, who have sought to create an image of youth and modernity. Meanwhile, as the queen saw her health deteriorate, the heir has had plenty of time in recent years to stand in for his mother in public events, allowing the British to become accustomed to his presence.', 'Time has forgiven Charles of England’s errors. His tempestuous relationship with Lady Di, and his infidelity, have long been pardoned. Gone, too, is the phone conversation with the woman who would become his wife, Camilla Parker-Bowles, in which he yearned to explore her anatomy in the form of a tampon. It was not the British monarchy’s most dignified moment —the Italian press referred to Charles as “Il Tampaccino”— but it never became sufficient cause to question the legitimacy of his access to the throne.', 'His snobbery and intellectualism has, at times, irritated the British. Their practical spirit and passion for individual liberty combines poorly with the transcendental mission with which Charles has spoken of his future reign. “My entire life has been so far motivated by a desire to heal the dismembered landscape and the poisoned soul,” he told an audience in 2002, “to heal the divisions between intuitive and rational thought, between mind and body and soul.”', 'Little by little, as the moment he had awaited his whole life approached, he began the task of convincing his countrymen that he understood the role of a king and the necessary neutrality. “Clearly I won’t be able to do the same things I’ve done as heir,” he admitted in an interview with the BBC to celebrate his 70th birthday. But causes for which he fought before they were popular —such as the fight against climate change, the damage of plastic waste, the quality of public health services and the need to preserve traditional trades— are today at the forefront of public interest.

I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world. During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which The Queen was so widely held,” he continued.', 'Unlike his mother, who kept her opinions about the United Kingdom’s polemical issues a mystery until her death, Charles of England takes the throne as an open book to the British people. Dozens of years waiting for his turn to arrive, and a restless character, caused the Prince of Wales to find himself in trouble more than necessary. But he also showed the citizenry that, in certain issues, like the fight against climate change or the need to save urban centers from decay, he was a man in touch with the times, and often ahead of his peers.', 'Walter Bagehot, the legendary editor of ', ' who wrote the essay about English government most consulted by the United Kingdom’s monarchs, observed that “the only fit material for a constitutional king is a prince who begins early to reign.” Charles, at 73 years old, has become an anomaly among monarchs of the 21st century, who have sought to create an image of youth and modernity. Meanwhile, as the queen saw her health deteriorate, the heir has had plenty of time in recent years to stand in for his mother in public events, allowing the British to become accustomed to his presence.', 'Time has forgiven Charles of England’s errors. His tempestuous relationship with Lady Di, and his infidelity, have long been pardoned. Gone, too, is the phone conversation with the woman who would become his wife, Camilla Parker-Bowles, in which he yearned to explore her anatomy in the form of a tampon. It was not the British monarchy’s most dignified moment —the Italian press referred to Charles as “Il Tampaccino”— but it never became sufficient cause to question the legitimacy of his access to the throne.', 'His snobbery and intellectualism has, at times, irritated the British. Their practical spirit and passion for individual liberty combines poorly with the transcendental mission with which Charles has spoken of his future reign. “My entire life has been so far motivated by a desire to heal the dismembered landscape and the poisoned soul,” he told an audience in 2002, “to heal the divisions between intuitive and rational thought, between mind and body and soul.”', 'Little by little, as the moment he had awaited his whole life approached, he began the task of convincing his countrymen that he understood the role of a king and the necessary neutrality. “Clearly I won’t be able to do the same things I’ve done as heir,” he admitted in an interview with the BBC to celebrate his 70th birthday. But causes for which he fought before they were popular —such as the fight against climate change, the damage of plastic waste, the quality of public health services and the need to preserve traditional trades— are today at the forefront of public interest. Now the new king steps into another plane, adopting the institutional neutrality that he has spent his lifetime preparing.']}\n",

While Thatcher ignored Mandela, Elizabeth II maintained indirect contact with him.', 'Ten years later, in 1996, already without Thatcher, Elizabeth II gave Mandela a treatment of honor on his first official trip to London: she hosted him at Buckingham Palace, accompanied him everywhere and, above all, allowed the South African president to call her “Lizzie.”', 'Another front of permanent political tension between monarchy and government opened in 1961, when Downing Street decided to apply for admission to the European institutions. The main leaders of the Commonwealth complained to Elizabeth II, as that nullified the preferential treaties they had with the United Kingdom. French President Charles de Gaulle vetoed the British membership and deferred the issue until the next decade. But a good part of Her Majesty’s subjects always opposed what was known as the Common Market. They feared losing their independence, represented precisely by the queen. Elizabeth II, like her successive governments, was forced to find a balance.']}\n",

Although hearings are scheduled to start in mid-October, thick legal briefs have already been filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery (civil court) in Twitter’s lawsuit against Elon Musk. The court will decide whether Musk is obligated to buy Twitter for $44 billion as stipulated in their merger agreement. Musk now wants to back out of the agreement, claiming Twitter failed to provide sufficient information and breached its agreement by firing top managers and laying off workers.', 'The world’s richest man may be unsure about winning the lawsuit, since he just sold', ' in case he is forced to buy Twitter or pay the $1 billion breakup fee. Musk was asked at Tesla’s recent shareholder meeting whether he would be spending most of his time at Twitter or the electric auto company. “I think Tesla, you know, would continue to do very well even if I was kidnapped by aliens, or went back to my home planet,” the Tesla CEO said, eliciting laughter and applause. “To be frank, I don’t have an easy answer,” he added.', 'The legal briefs filed by both parties indicate that Musk may have jumped into the deal without doing the usual homework and signed a contract that left him few escape clauses. Twitter’s case has few cracks and seems to have a good chance of winning. Musk’s legal team is surely searching for any weaknesses it can exploit and will undoubtedly mount a vigorous defense. And Musk is adept at pulling rabbits out of hats.', 'It’s going to be a speedy trial. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the head judge of Delaware’s Court of Chancery will hear the case. Many corporations choose to incorporate in the small US state of Delaware because of the corporate tax benefits and up-to-date body of corporate law. Delaware’s special commercial court, the Court of Chancery, has expert judges who can rule on corporate law disputes without juries. There are more large companies domiciled in Delaware than in the other 49 US states combined, as a long-time Delaware resident, President Joe Biden, regularly reminds us.', 'The Delaware Court of Chancery was established in 1792, shortly after US independence, and over the last two centuries has become the preferred arbiter of major US corporate disputes. It has settled business quarrels pitting companies against disgruntled shareholders, or parties to troubled mergers and acquisitions, such as RJ Reynolds and Nabisco, Time and Warner, HP and Compaq, and LVMH and Tiffany. But none of these high-profile cases can compare to the public battle between the eccentric, richest man in the world and the popular social network with $44 billion at stake.', 'McCormick scheduled the start of the trial for the week of October 17-21, ', ', who wanted a delay to February 2023. The judge has established an accelerated schedule for discovery, subpoenas, depositions, expert requests, witness lists, and pretrial hearings. The two sides have kicked into gear. Musk has already requested transaction-related documentation from Twitter’s bankers, JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, Twitter has subpoenaed Musk associates, friends, and allies, including Oracle co-founder and executive chairman Larry Ellison, who is also a Tesla advisor; PayPal co-founder Jason Calacanis, an investor in Uber and Robinhood, and a partner in Musk’s Twitter deal; and PayPal co-founder David Sacks, who replied with a digital middle finger.', 'The complaint, counterclaim and reply to the counterclaim filed with the Delaware court clearly reveal the direction of each party’s pre-trial strategy. Twitter’s lawsuit begins forcefully: “In April 2022, Elon Musk entered into a binding merger agreement with Twitter, promising to use his best efforts to get the deal done. Now, less than three months later, Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests. Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he – unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law – is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.”', 'Twitter says that Musk made a “take it or leave it” offer, but did not make it conditional upon the results of a due diligence process or upon the financing of the transaction. The company argues that Musk now wants to renege on the deal because Twitter’s stock price has fallen. “Musk’s exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy,” says the Twitter complaint, because after saying he wanted to buy the company to get rid of spam bots and fake accounts, he now points to fake accounts as the reasons for backing out of the deal.', 'Twitter also claims that Musk’s strategy is a model of bad faith. “While pretending to exercise the narrow right he has under the merger agreement to information for ‘consummation of the transaction,’ Musk has been working furiously – albeit fruitlessly – to try to show that the company he promised to buy and not disparage has made material misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors.', 'The Twitter lawsuit indicates that Musk’s notice to Twitter alleged three grounds for terminating the agreement. First, there was a “purported breach of information-sharing and cooperation covenants” by Twitter. Second, Twitter supposedly made “materially inaccurate representations” in the merger agreement that allegedly are “reasonably likely to result in” a material adverse effect. Third, Twitter purportedly failed to comply with “the ordinary course covenant by terminating certain employees, slowing hiring, and failing to retain key personnel.” After laying out Musk’s alleged motives for terminating the agreement, the Twitter brief proceeds to refute them one by one.', 'The lawsuit is an inside look at how the merger negotiations unfolded. After buying more than 9% of the company’s stock on the open market, Musk told Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal that he was thinking about either joining Twitter’s board, buying the company or starting a competing company. Musk accepted the board seat offered by Twitter in April, but changed his mind a few days later and said', '. He submitted an offer that was initially conditioned upon financing and due diligence, but then withdrew those conditions. Musk’s lawyers presented a seller-friendly draft agreement to close the deal as soon as possible. Twitter’s lawyers won a few more concessions, including the right to hire or fire employees until the deal closed without Musk’s consent.', 'In the merger agreement, Musk stated that he was satisfied with the results of his own investigation, review and analysis of Twitter’s business operations. The social network promised to provide Musk with information that would facilitate closing the transaction, and ', ' or its executives.', 'Twitter argues that Musk decided to back out after realizing that his offer of $54.20 per share was too high, especially after the stock market dropped sharply. “Musk wanted an escape,” says the Twitter brief. “But the merger agreement left him little room. With no financing contingency or diligence condition, the agreement gave Musk no out absent a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material covenant breach by Twitter. Musk had to try to conjure one of those.”', 'Although the Twitter sale agreement never mentions fake user accounts, Musk repeatedly stated he wanted to buy the company to purge them from the platform. Yet Musk made his offer without seeking any representation from Twitter regarding its estimates of', '. He even sweetened his offer to the Twitter board by expressly withdrawing his prior diligence condition.', 'In early information-gathering meetings, Musk was interested in how Twitter counted its users, especially the monetizable daily active users (mDAU). Twitter believes that the best way to measure its success is to count the mDAU – users who log in and access Twitter on any given day through ', ' or Twitter applications that are able to show ads. Musk was not convinced by the explanations, and on May 13, without formally notifying Twitter, he tweeted that the agreement was “temporarily on hold” until he understood how they determined that fewer than 5% of the mDAU were fake accounts. Two hours later, after speaking with Twitter executives, Musk tweeted that he remained “committed” to the agreement.', 'The commitment was short-lived, as less than a week later, Musk responded to Twitter’s technical explanation of the fake account calculation issue by tweeting a smiling poop emoji, a message for the ages.', 'Twitter says it never withheld information from Musk and provided a torrent of data – almost 54 terabytes worth – but it was not enough for Musk who sent a letter in mid-June that Twitter described as “… an alternative reality in which Twitter had failed to cooperate in supplying Musk with information,” according to the Twitter complaint. The letter contained a litigation-style discovery demand for information Musk asserted was needed to investigate its active user base. Twitter began to suspect that Musk was seeking a pretext to break the agreement and refused to respond to some of those requests.', 'In a June 30 meeting, Musk acknowledged he had not read the detailed summary of Twitter’s sampling process provided back in May. Twitter offered to meet again and review the detailed sampling methodology sampling process, but that meeting never occurred despite multiple attempts by Twitter.', 'Lastly, regarding workforce layoffs, Twitter claims that it reserved that right and notes that Musk wanted the company to be more aggressive in cutting costs and headcount. With respect to employee attrition, Twitter maintains that employees have every right to voluntarily leave the company, and says that Musk refused to approve employee retention plans.', 'The counterclaim brief acknowledges that Musk waived the normal due diligence process and instead followed the adage “trust but verify.” When he went to verify, Musk concluded that Twitter had been misleading the market for years and had been filing false information with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The counterclaim states that the SEC disclosures “… contain numerous, material misrepresentations or omissions that distort Twitter’s value and caused the Musk Parties to agree to acquire the company at an inflated price.”', 'On the controversy over fake and spam accounts, the counterclaim states, “Twitter was miscounting the number of false and spam accounts on its platform, as part of its scheme to mislead investors about the company’s prospects by focusing on its purported hundreds of millions of mDAU.” It also claims that although Twitter has repeatedly touted mDAU as a “key metric” for revenue growth, mDAU is not as closely tied to revenue as Twitter leads the public to believe, because many accounts are barely active and to say they are monetizable is misleading.', 'The counterclaim brief proceeds to make a legally irrelevant point, proclaiming that “Musk is an avid Twitter user who believes in free speech and open debate, and he appreciates Twitter’s role as the world’s town hall.” But he rejects aggressive content moderation and suspension of accounts that propagate misinformation. To Musk, and many others, eliminating free speech is a cure worse than the disease.', 'By buying Twitter, Musk believed he could kill two birds with one stone. By requiring effective verification of all users, he could eliminate what was supposed to be a less-than-5% false or spam account problem. Then he could better engage the over 220 million mDAU that Twitter represented were real, monetizable users and enhance subscription revenue.', 'The counterclaim is contradictory in places. It says that “… Twitter frantically [closed] the gates on information in a desperate bid to prevent the Musk Parties from uncovering its fraud.” Yet it then relies on that same Twitter-supplied information and data to conclude that at least 10% of the mDAU are fake. The brief often slips into lyrical critiques of the company’s management and its business model. “As a long bull market was coming to a close, and the tide was going out, Twitter knew that providing the Musk Parties the information they were requesting would reveal that Twitter had been swimming naked.” Musk believes Twitter was in a hurry to close the deal because its fraud would be discovered during the presentation of second quarter results at the analyst conference, which was ultimately cancelled because of the merger agreement. It’s clear to everyone, however, that Musk was driving the timeline.', 'The counterclaim alleges that Twitter stonewalled and chose not to disclose its mDAU calculation methodology. Instead, it engaged in “an unending game of cat-and-mouse, with Twitter obfuscating the truth at every turn” and parroted “the mantra that its process was robust” without ever explaining it.', 'Somewhat desperately, Musk’s lawyers also argue that Twitter made significant changes to its business without obtaining the consent required by the merger agreement when it “disobeyed orders from and initiated risky litigation against the Indian government – thereby placing Twitter’s third largest market at risk.” This is a new argument that was not mentioned in the merger agreement termination notice.', 'Ultimately, Musk is accusing Twitter of fraud, violation of securities laws and breach of contract. He is asking for termination of the merger agreement and is seeking “an award of compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.” The counterclaim asserts that Twitter has not suffered losses and is not entitled “to recover losses suffered by third parties, including, among others, its shareholders.” And it reiterates that “the merger agreement was fraudulently induced.”', 'Twitter’s reply to Musk’s counterclaim begins by wryly observing, “According to Musk, he – the billionaire founder of multiple companies, advised by Wall Street bankers and lawyers – was hoodwinked by Twitter into signing a $44 billion merger agreement.” The response goes on to say, “… the Counterclaims are factually inaccurate, legally insufficient, and commercially irrelevant.” The merger agreement does not contain a single reference to fake or spam accounts, insists Twitter, and charges Musk with selectively wielding confidential data provided by Twitter to allege a breach. “Yet Musk simultaneously and incoherently asserts that Twitter breached the merger agreement by stonewalling his information requests.”', 'Twitter claims that Musk’s calculation of 10% fake accounts didn’t measure the same thing as Twitter or even use the same data, and was done using a generic web tool that designated his own Twitter account a likely “bot.” Musk has more than 100 million followers and has tweeted more than 18,000 times.', '“The Musk Parties have spent months trying to invent a spam disclosure problem and have found nothing. Their complaints about the mDAU metric were not even among their reasons for termination – they are a newly invented litigating position.” Twitter makes the same claim about its litigation with the Indian government, saying it’s nothing new or exceptional, and was not mentioned in Musk’s termination notice.', 'Some surprises are surely in store, but as things stand now, Musk’s legal position looks difficult. Judge McCormick is known for her enforcement of transaction agreements. If that happens, Musk’s last hope is the unlikely possibility that Twitter shareholders will vote against the merger in their annual meeting. Musk can also try to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with Twitter. If not, it will all play out in court.', 'The second half of October looks tough for Musk. The week after the Twitter trial begins, he faces another lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery from Tesla shareholders seeking to void the CEO’s record-breaking $56 billion pay package, alleging corporate waste and unjust enrichment.']}\n",

Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he – unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law – is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.”', 'Twitter says that Musk made a “take it or leave it” offer, but did not make it conditional upon the results of a due diligence process or upon the financing of the transaction. The company argues that Musk now wants to renege on the deal because Twitter’s stock price has fallen. “Musk’s exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy,” says the Twitter complaint, because after saying he wanted to buy the company to get rid of spam bots and fake accounts, he now points to fake accounts as the reasons for backing out of the deal.', 'Twitter also claims that Musk’s strategy is a model of bad faith. “While pretending to exercise the narrow right he has under the merger agreement to information for ‘consummation of the transaction,’ Musk has been working furiously – albeit fruitlessly – to try to show that the company he promised to buy and not disparage has made material misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors.', 'The Twitter lawsuit indicates that Musk’s notice to Twitter alleged three grounds for terminating the agreement. First, there was a “purported breach of information-sharing and cooperation covenants” by Twitter. Second, Twitter supposedly made “materially inaccurate representations” in the merger agreement that allegedly are “reasonably likely to result in” a material adverse effect. Third, Twitter purportedly failed to comply with “the ordinary course covenant by terminating certain employees, slowing hiring, and failing to retain key personnel.” After laying out Musk’s alleged motives for terminating the agreement, the Twitter brief proceeds to refute them one by one.', 'The lawsuit is an inside look at how the merger negotiations unfolded. After buying more than 9% of the company’s stock on the open market, Musk told Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal that he was thinking about either joining Twitter’s board, buying the company or starting a competing company. Musk accepted the board seat offered by Twitter in April, but changed his mind a few days later and said', '. He submitted an offer that was initially conditioned upon financing and due diligence, but then withdrew those conditions. Musk’s lawyers presented a seller-friendly draft agreement to close the deal as soon as possible. Twitter’s lawyers won a few more concessions, including the right to hire or fire employees until the deal closed without Musk’s consent.', 'In the merger agreement, Musk stated that he was satisfied with the results of his own investigation, review and analysis of Twitter’s business operations. The social network promised to provide Musk with information that would facilitate closing the transaction, and ', ' or its executives.', 'Twitter argues that Musk decided to back out after realizing that his offer of $54.20 per share was too high, especially after the stock market dropped sharply. “Musk wanted an escape,” says the Twitter brief. “But the merger agreement left him little room. With no financing contingency or diligence condition, the agreement gave Musk no out absent a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material covenant breach by Twitter. Musk had to try to conjure one of those.”', 'Although the Twitter sale agreement never mentions fake user accounts, Musk repeatedly stated he wanted to buy the company to purge them from the platform. Yet Musk made his offer without seeking any representation from Twitter regarding its estimates of', '. He even sweetened his offer to the Twitter board by expressly withdrawing his prior diligence condition.', 'In early information-gathering meetings, Musk was interested in how Twitter counted its users, especially the monetizable daily active users (mDAU). Twitter believes that the best way to measure its success is to count the mDAU – users who log in and access Twitter on any given day through ', ' or Twitter applications that are able to show ads. Musk was not convinced by the explanations, and on May 13, without formally notifying Twitter, he tweeted that the agreement was “temporarily on hold” until he understood how they determined that fewer than 5% of the mDAU were fake accounts. Two hours later, after speaking with Twitter executives, Musk tweeted that he remained “committed” to the agreement.', 'The commitment was short-lived, as less than a week later, Musk responded to Twitter’s technical explanation of the fake account calculation issue by tweeting a smiling poop emoji, a message for the ages.', 'Twitter says it never withheld information from Musk and provided a torrent of data – almost 54 terabytes worth – but it was not enough for Musk who sent a letter in mid-June that Twitter described as “… an alternative reality in which Twitter had failed to cooperate in supplying Musk with information,” according to the Twitter complaint. The letter contained a litigation-style discovery demand for information Musk asserted was needed to investigate its active user base. Twitter began to suspect that Musk was seeking a pretext to break the agreement and refused to respond to some of those requests.', 'In a June 30 meeting, Musk acknowledged he had not read the detailed summary of Twitter’s sampling process provided back in May. Twitter offered to meet again and review the detailed sampling methodology sampling process, but that meeting never occurred despite multiple attempts by Twitter.', 'Lastly, regarding workforce layoffs, Twitter claims that it reserved that right and notes that Musk wanted the company to be more aggressive in cutting costs and headcount. With respect to employee attrition, Twitter maintains that employees have every right to voluntarily leave the company, and says that Musk refused to approve employee retention plans.', 'The counterclaim brief acknowledges that Musk waived the normal due diligence process and instead followed the adage “trust but verify.” When he went to verify, Musk concluded that Twitter had been misleading the market for years and had been filing false information with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The counterclaim states that the SEC disclosures “… contain numerous, material misrepresentations or omissions that distort Twitter’s value and caused the Musk Parties to agree to acquire the company at an inflated price.”', 'On the controversy over fake and spam accounts, the counterclaim states, “Twitter was miscounting the number of false and spam accounts on its platform, as part of its scheme to mislead investors about the company’s prospects by focusing on its purported hundreds of millions of mDAU.” It also claims that although Twitter has repeatedly touted mDAU as a “key metric” for revenue growth, mDAU is not as closely tied to revenue as Twitter leads the public to believe, because many accounts are barely active and to say they are monetizable is misleading.', 'The counterclaim brief proceeds to make a legally irrelevant point, proclaiming that “Musk is an avid Twitter user who believes in free speech and open debate, and he appreciates Twitter’s role as the world’s town hall.” But he rejects aggressive content moderation and suspension of accounts that propagate misinformation. To Musk, and many others, eliminating free speech is a cure worse than the disease.', 'By buying Twitter, Musk believed he could kill two birds with one stone. By requiring effective verification of all users, he could eliminate what was supposed to be a less-than-5% false or spam account problem. Then he could better engage the over 220 million mDAU that Twitter represented were real, monetizable users and enhance subscription revenue.', 'The counterclaim is contradictory in places. It says that “… Twitter frantically [closed] the gates on information in a desperate bid to prevent the Musk Parties from uncovering its fraud.” Yet it then relies on that same Twitter-supplied information and data to conclude that at least 10% of the mDAU are fake. The brief often slips into lyrical critiques of the company’s management and its business model. “As a long bull market was coming to a close, and the tide was going out, Twitter knew that providing the Musk Parties the information they were requesting would reveal that Twitter had been swimming naked.” Musk believes Twitter was in a hurry to close the deal because its fraud would be discovered during the presentation of second quarter results at the analyst conference, which was ultimately cancelled because of the merger agreement. It’s clear to everyone, however, that Musk was driving the timeline.', 'The counterclaim alleges that Twitter stonewalled and chose not to disclose its mDAU calculation methodology. Instead, it engaged in “an unending game of cat-and-mouse, with Twitter obfuscating the truth at every turn” and parroted “the mantra that its process was robust” without ever explaining it.', 'Somewhat desperately, Musk’s lawyers also argue that Twitter made significant changes to its business without obtaining the consent required by the merger agreement when it “disobeyed orders from and initiated risky litigation against the Indian government – thereby placing Twitter’s third largest market at risk.” This is a new argument that was not mentioned in the merger agreement termination notice.', 'Ultimately, Musk is accusing Twitter of fraud, violation of securities laws and breach of contract. He is asking for termination of the merger agreement and is seeking “an award of compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.” The counterclaim asserts that Twitter has not suffered losses and is not entitled “to recover losses suffered by third parties, including, among others, its shareholders.” And it reiterates that “the merger agreement was fraudulently induced.”', 'Twitter’s reply to Musk’s counterclaim begins by wryly observing, “According to Musk, he – the billionaire founder of multiple companies, advised by Wall Street bankers and lawyers – was hoodwinked by Twitter into signing a $44 billion merger agreement.” The response goes on to say, “… the Counterclaims are factually inaccurate, legally insufficient, and commercially irrelevant.” The merger agreement does not contain a single reference to fake or spam accounts, insists Twitter, and charges Musk with selectively wielding confidential data provided by Twitter to allege a breach. “Yet Musk simultaneously and incoherently asserts that Twitter breached the merger agreement by stonewalling his information requests.”', 'Twitter claims that Musk’s calculation of 10% fake accounts didn’t measure the same thing as Twitter or even use the same data, and was done using a generic web tool that designated his own Twitter account a likely “bot.” Musk has more than 100 million followers and has tweeted more than 18,000 times.', '“The Musk Parties have spent months trying to invent a spam disclosure problem and have found nothing. Their complaints about the mDAU metric were not even among their reasons for termination – they are a newly invented litigating position.” Twitter makes the same claim about its litigation with the Indian government, saying it’s nothing new or exceptional, and was not mentioned in Musk’s termination notice.', 'Some surprises are surely in store, but as things stand now, Musk’s legal position looks difficult. Judge McCormick is known for her enforcement of transaction agreements. If that happens, Musk’s last hope is the unlikely possibility that Twitter shareholders will vote against the merger in their annual meeting. Musk can also try to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with Twitter. If not, it will all play out in court.', 'The second half of October looks tough for Musk. The week after the Twitter trial begins, he faces another lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery from Tesla shareholders seeking to void the CEO’s record-breaking $56 billion pay package, alleging corporate waste and unjust enrichment.']}\n",

The EU has already been overtaken as a trading partner by China in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela.', 'López believes that, in spite of everything, the conditions are there to push Europe to build a stronger relationship with Latin America. “First, the war, because the EU needs to find allies; secondly, Europe needs to seek suppliers of hydrocarbons and raw materials, which abound on the other side of the Atlantic; and thirdly, the Spanish presidency of the EU, which sets a horizon of 18 months to program an ambitious agenda.”', 'The European Commission has a budget of €3.4 billion to promote cooperation with Latin America during the 2021-2017 period. Borrell’s department, according to the confidential report, believes these funds should be exploited “strategically and for maximum impact.” Brussels is also considering an investment package that, using public and private capital and credits, could mobilize €8 billion, according to the EU’s calculations. And this is not mere altruism. The EU document highlights that three countries in the area – Bolivia, Argentina and Chile – have 60% of the lithium reserves located on the planet, and Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil have important oil and gas reserves. These are hydrocarbons in which the EU is about to lose its main supplier: Russia.']}\n",

Zweig remembered the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic with astonishment, recounting how a family ended up needing millions of marks just to get through the day, could hardly find coal to heat themselves in winter, while the value of the mark sank and “vultures” with foreign currency hoarded everything in sight.', 'The soaring rise in prices, one of the economic trends most feared by governments, has now reached levels unseen in 40 years, and it is affecting a good portion of the world’s developed economies. Europe, the United States, Canada ', ' are now experiencing in excess or close to a double-digit inflation rate, when the orthodoxy indicates that it should hover around 2%. And the central banks, which determine monetary policy and have a mandate to control inflation, have sounded the alarm. In these situations, the handbook recommends raising interest rates, that is, making loans to companies and households more expensive, in order to reduce demand and rein in prices.', '“Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth... some softening of ', ' conditions...

Alan Greenspan’s Fed did it in the 1990s, raising the price of money to 6%, but the rate of inflation was almost half what it is today and its motives less complex.

Liberal democracy had triumphed, he said.', 'However, in his new book, ', ', he detects new threats to the classical liberal model that he defends. On the one hand, misguided neoliberalism – which demonized the state – put an end to solidarity, generating unsustainable inequality. On the other, runaway identity currents – be it the conspiratorial nationalist right or a left that is too focused on minorities – have created new societal ruptures.', 'The 69-year-old Chicago-born political scientist received EL PAÍS at the Rafael del Pino Foundation in Madrid.', ' When we talk about liberalism, we associate it with the center-right, although if we think back to the French Revolution, it was more associated with the left.', ' I have a very broad definition of liberalism… in Europe, you’re right, it’s associated with the center-right. In the United States, it’s associated with the left. I say that liberalism is a doctrine that protects individual rights and limits the power of the state. And it can be either left or right in economic terms. But what’s important is the rule of law as a foundation for a society.', ' How did liberalism lead to the neoliberalism that you criticize?', 'I think that there was excess state regulation and state interference in economies that had developed by the 1970s. And so, you had politicians like ', ' and Margaret Thatcher that tried to roll back some of that regulation. They were supported in this by very prominent economists, like Milton Friedman. The problem was that [they] went too far and attempted to undermine all forms of state activity, even necessary ones, for example, of regulating the financial system. And as a result, we ended up with a globalization that increased inequality and led to substantial instability in the global financial system. And this, of course, provoked a populist backlash that you see both on the left and the right, which partially explains why we are where we are today.', ' Sometimes you hear justifications for economic inequality. To what extent is inequality justified?', ' I think that there always has to be some balance between the need for economic growth and the need for a society that protects people from at least the worst aspects of a market economy.', ' But right now inequality is starting to be problematic.', ' Well, I don’t think that you can generalize. In Latin America, you have a continent that has experienced a great degree of inequality. A lot of the populist politics that you see in places like Argentina or Venezuela are the result of this kind of inequality, which leads to both very bad economic outcomes, but also very bad politics, because we have this polarization between a populist left and ultra-conservative right. In other parts of the world, it’s not [the case]. In Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, you’ve had ', ' in power for a long time. [They’ve] done a lot of redistribution – you don’t get this kind of polarized politics and you have an alteration between the center-left and center-right, which I think is much healthier.', ' I have the impression, from reading your book, that you’ve taken a turn towards a more social democratic vision.', ' Well, I was never opposed to social democracy. I think that it really depends on the historical period and the degree of state intervention. By the 1960s, many social democratic societies had become mired in low growth [and] high inflation. At that point, I think it was important to roll some of that back. That is, in fact, what happened in Scandinavia. Most of those countries reduced tax rates, reduced levels of regulation and therefore became more productive. But I think that in the current period, we need more social democracy, especially in the United States. We still don’t have universal health care, which I think is ridiculous for a rich country, a rich democratic country. My attitude towards social democracy really depends on what period you’re talking about and what country you’re talking about.', 'In Spain, when people talk about identity politics, such as feminism or the LGTBQ+ movement, they are sometimes criticized as collectivist. In your book, they seem to have their roots in classical liberalism, in the affirmation of individual rights.', 'Identity politics arise because certain groups are discriminated against or marginalized. And it’s perfectly legitimate to use identity as a means of social mobilization to push back against marginalization. I think that identity politics becomes problematic in a liberal society when one’s fixed identity becomes the most essential thing that one knows about somebody, when you’re making judgments about people simply on the basis of their membership in a group and not what they’ve accomplished as individuals. There’s an acceptable liberal version of identity politics, but I think it can be very problematic.', 'These groups are sometimes accused of', '.” Does such a culture exist?', 'In certain parts of the United States and other countries you have a very intolerant form of progressive politics that really does not want alternative views to be expressed. And so, yes, people are cancelled and fired from [their] jobs or shouted down. And that’s particularly problematic when it happens in universities, because universities are dedicated to free expression and the free exploration of ideas. [This is] a dangerous trend that’s been promoted by a certain version of identity politics.', ' There are cases of this phenomenon in Spain, but it’s not clear if they should be labelled as part of a “culture.”', ' Well, it’s not a general culture. I think that in the United States, it’s probably more extreme than in Spain or many European countries. Partly it has to do with our racial history, because racial inequality was the first and most basic civil rights issue. It was a very big problem in the United States and it became a pattern for other groups: for women, for gays and lesbians and transgender people to assert their rights. So I think it’s an issue of particular sensitivity. But I agree with you. It’s not clear that it’s a general culture because it’s something that is particularly prominent in more elite institutions like universities or Hollywood or the traditional media. But it’s not, generally speaking, in the society as a whole.', ' How has the internet affected the way we talk about politics?', ' The internet has made possible the amplification of certain voices on a scale that is unprecedented… but it has also been able to silence certain voices, because social media is the primary means by which we communicate politically these days. And I think both of [these factors] are problematic in terms of freedom of speech.', ' Are we living through a crisis of trust that has been caused by social media?', ' Trust in institutions has been declining for 50 years. [This] decline has accelerated because there are anti-democratic forces that actively want to undermine trust. For example, what the Russians have done in social media is not to promulgate their point of view – it’s really to undermine the trust that people have in democratic societies, in their institutions.', ' Liberalism defends the autonomy of the individual. To what extent should societies be individualistic?', ' Societies need to have common social values. You can’t communicate if you don’t have a common language and a common set of cultural reference points by which you can interact with other people. When individualism gets to the point where people are actually making up their own values systems or living in close cultural communities where they can’t communicate or interact, I think that’s an excessive degree of individualism.', 'How do we find a balance?', 'I think that you have to rely on the fact that human beings are social creatures that have powerful social instincts. We have to balance between excessive individualism, but also an excessive degree of social conformity.', 'To what extent can individual freedom – something so sacred to liberals – be limited?', 'All liberal societies have to [be able to] preserve their own institutions. When you get a political party, for example, that is anti-democratic or anti-liberal, that, if it gains power, it’s going to shut down freedom of expression, not going to permit future democratic elections and so forth, a liberal society has the right to defend itself.', 'During the Cold War, you had a number of communist parties in France, Italy and Spain that were anti-liberal… there was a lot of resistance to them being permitted to freely participate in the system because there was a fear that, if they came to power, they would never leave power. I think there was a similar suspicion of a lot of Islamist parties. That was one of the reasons for the reaction against the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. A liberal society must [have the ability] to protect itself from illiberal forces.', 'Is there a risk of moving towards an illiberal world?', ' There are two separate threats right now. The most severe one is from a resurgent populist nationalism that’s represented by Orbán in Hungary, by Erdoğan in Turkey, by Modi in India, by Donald Trump in the United States. All of these people were legitimately elected… but they use their legitimacy to threaten illiberal institutions. They want to eliminate the independent court system, they want to shut down opposition media, they [weaponize] the justice system to go after their political opponents. Then, there’s a separate threat coming from the left, which mostly applies in cultural settings, because you don’t have a left that’s come to power in quite the same way, at least in Europe and in North America. In Latin America, it’s different, because you do have a ', ' that has behaved in a very similar authoritarian way in Venezuela and Nicaragua.', 'Are liberalism and democracy always fellow travellers?', 'They are allies and they support each other, but they don’t necessarily have to exist at the same time. Orbán wants an illiberal democracy, with elections, but without freedom of the press or belief or free opposition. There are also liberal societies without democracy, like Singapore: there is individual freedom, but there are no elections.', ' What do you think of the recently', '?', ' Well, he [leaves behind] a very mixed legacy. I think he remained a communist to the end. He didn’t want the Soviet Union to fall apart in the way that it did. But among communists, he had some very liberal tendencies. Glasnost was basically an appeal for greater freedom of expression… and that actually ended up undermining the former Soviet Union, because when people were allowed to speak freely, it turned out that, in many of the republics of the Soviet Union, what they said was: “I want my country to be separate from the Soviet Union.” It happened in the Baltics and in Ukraine and in many other places. Gorbachev did not intend for that to happen and he was very upset that it did. But I think, honestly, we have to admit that, without Gorbachev, all those countries would still be trapped in a Soviet dictatorship.', 'In the 1990s, you spoke of “the end of history.” Now we talk more about the end of the world!', ' I never said that liberal democracy would triumph everywhere, or that it would be the system that would end all our problems. If you take something like climate change – especially generated by economic growth – I don’t think that liberal democracy is worse at managing it than authoritarian governments, as is sometimes thought. Democracies have been more efficient in reducing emissions. The Chinese economy, for example, is based on fossil fuels.', ' How do you see the future of civilization?', ' I’m optimistic in the sense that I believe that there’s been a lot of progress. Historically, if we take a very long view of history, humans have been remarkably able to adapt and shape their world.']}\n",

And so, yes, people are cancelled and fired from [their] jobs or shouted down. And that’s particularly problematic when it happens in universities, because universities are dedicated to free expression and the free exploration of ideas. [This is] a dangerous trend that’s been promoted by a certain version of identity politics.', ' There are cases of this phenomenon in Spain, but it’s not clear if they should be labelled as part of a “culture.”', ' Well, it’s not a general culture. I think that in the United States, it’s probably more extreme than in Spain or many European countries. Partly it has to do with our racial history, because racial inequality was the first and most basic civil rights issue. It was a very big problem in the United States and it became a pattern for other groups: for women, for gays and lesbians and transgender people to assert their rights. So I think it’s an issue of particular sensitivity. But I agree with you. It’s not clear that it’s a general culture because it’s something that is particularly prominent in more elite institutions like universities or Hollywood or the traditional media. But it’s not, generally speaking, in the society as a whole.', ' How has the internet affected the way we talk about politics?', ' The internet has made possible the amplification of certain voices on a scale that is unprecedented… but it has also been able to silence certain voices, because social media is the primary means by which we communicate politically these days. And I think both of [these factors] are problematic in terms of freedom of speech.', ' Are we living through a crisis of trust that has been caused by social media?', ' Trust in institutions has been declining for 50 years. [This] decline has accelerated because there are anti-democratic forces that actively want to undermine trust. For example, what the Russians have done in social media is not to promulgate their point of view – it’s really to undermine the trust that people have in democratic societies, in their institutions.', ' Liberalism defends the autonomy of the individual. To what extent should societies be individualistic?', ' Societies need to have common social values. You can’t communicate if you don’t have a common language and a common set of cultural reference points by which you can interact with other people. When individualism gets to the point where people are actually making up their own values systems or living in close cultural communities where they can’t communicate or interact, I think that’s an excessive degree of individualism.', 'How do we find a balance?', 'I think that you have to rely on the fact that human beings are social creatures that have powerful social instincts. We have to balance between excessive individualism, but also an excessive degree of social conformity.', 'To what extent can individual freedom – something so sacred to liberals – be limited?', 'All liberal societies have to [be able to] preserve their own institutions. When you get a political party, for example, that is anti-democratic or anti-liberal, that, if it gains power, it’s going to shut down freedom of expression, not going to permit future democratic elections and so forth, a liberal society has the right to defend itself.', 'During the Cold War, you had a number of communist parties in France, Italy and Spain that were anti-liberal… there was a lot of resistance to them being permitted to freely participate in the system because there was a fear that, if they came to power, they would never leave power. I think there was a similar suspicion of a lot of Islamist parties. That was one of the reasons for the reaction against the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. A liberal society must [have the ability] to protect itself from illiberal forces.', 'Is there a risk of moving towards an illiberal world?', ' There are two separate threats right now. The most severe one is from a resurgent populist nationalism that’s represented by Orbán in Hungary, by Erdoğan in Turkey, by Modi in India, by Donald Trump in the United States. All of these people were legitimately elected… but they use their legitimacy to threaten illiberal institutions. They want to eliminate the independent court system, they want to shut down opposition media, they [weaponize] the justice system to go after their political opponents. Then, there’s a separate threat coming from the left, which mostly applies in cultural settings, because you don’t have a left that’s come to power in quite the same way, at least in Europe and in North America. In Latin America, it’s different, because you do have a ', ' that has behaved in a very similar authoritarian way in Venezuela and Nicaragua.', 'Are liberalism and democracy always fellow travellers?', 'They are allies and they support each other, but they don’t necessarily have to exist at the same time. Orbán wants an illiberal democracy, with elections, but without freedom of the press or belief or free opposition. There are also liberal societies without democracy, like Singapore: there is individual freedom, but there are no elections.', ' What do you think of the recently', '?', ' Well, he [leaves behind] a very mixed legacy. I think he remained a communist to the end. He didn’t want the Soviet Union to fall apart in the way that it did. But among communists, he had some very liberal tendencies. Glasnost was basically an appeal for greater freedom of expression… and that actually ended up undermining the former Soviet Union, because when people were allowed to speak freely, it turned out that, in many of the republics of the Soviet Union, what they said was: “I want my country to be separate from the Soviet Union.” It happened in the Baltics and in Ukraine and in many other places. Gorbachev did not intend for that to happen and he was very upset that it did. But I think, honestly, we have to admit that, without Gorbachev, all those countries would still be trapped in a Soviet dictatorship.', 'In the 1990s, you spoke of “the end of history.” Now we talk more about the end of the world!', ' I never said that liberal democracy would triumph everywhere, or that it would be the system that would end all our problems. If you take something like climate change – especially generated by economic growth – I don’t think that liberal democracy is worse at managing it than authoritarian governments, as is sometimes thought. Democracies have been more efficient in reducing emissions. The Chinese economy, for example, is based on fossil fuels.', ' How do you see the future of civilization?', ' I’m optimistic in the sense that I believe that there’s been a lot of progress. Historically, if we take a very long view of history, humans have been remarkably able to adapt and shape their world.']}\n",

       "'Disney has overtaken Netflix to become the TV streaming service with the highest number of subscribers. On Wednesday, the company announced that its three platforms – Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu – had 221.1 million subscribers worldwide, compared to,.,“We had an excellent quarter, with our world-class creative and business teams powering outstanding performance at our domestic theme parks, big increases in live-sports viewership, and significant subscriber growth at our streaming services. With 14.4 million Disney+ subscribers added in the fiscal third quarter, we now have 221 million total subscriptions across our streaming offerings,” said Bob Chapek, chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Company,.,It is, however, difficult to compare Disney and Netflix: the former has ,, while the latter has just one. According to the press release, Disney+ has 152.1 million subscribers, up 31% since last year, with most new subscribers outside the United States. ESPN+, which specializes in sport broadcasts, has grown 53% in one year, reaching 22.8 million subscribers. While, Hulu, which mainly broadcasts TV shows, has 46.2 million subscribers, a rise of 8%.,Disney’s rise to the top, however, may be short-lived. The total number of subscribers includes 58.4 million subscriptions to the Disney+ Hotstar service in India. This platform has lost the rights to broadcast cricket league matches, the country’s top sport, and analysts believe this could cost Disney millions in subscribers. In fact, the company downgraded subscriber forecast for September 2023, from between 230 million and 260 million to between 215 million and 245 million.,How much revenue Disney receives per subscriber varies greatly according to the service. Disney earns an average of $4.55 and $4.35 per customer for ESPN+ and Disney+, respectively. The latter platform includes the Hotstar service in India, which generates just $1.2 a month per subscription. In the United States, Disney earns an average of more than $6 per subscriber.,Disney has announced an ,. The service will be available from December 8, and cost $7.99 a month. Meanwhile, the cost of the ad-free Disney+ platform has increased to $10.99 a month. Hulu subscriptions have risen from $13.99 to $14.99 month, while its ad-supported offering will cost $7.99. For all three platforms, the monthly cost is $19.99 or $12.99 ad-supported subscriptions.,Both Netflix and Warner (HBO Max and Discovery) have announced plans to offer lower cost subscriptions, either supported by ads or that have a more limited offering.,Disney theme park revenues have also skyrocketed due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, with Disneyland Paris already recording pre-pandemic revenue. Disney also recorded an increase in theatrical distribution result due to box office hits such as ,. In the third quarter, Disney’s total revenue rose by 26%, to $21.5 billion, while net income shot up 53% to $1.5 billion, according to the company.'"

Until fairly recently, , tackled K2. The rest lined up for the far more accessible Everest. And that’s why, as of February 2021, according to the Himalayan Database’s count, Everest had 10,658 confirmed summits and K2 just 377.,But something has changed. This summer, climbers have been lining up to summit the second-highest mountain on the planet. As a result, in a single recent day, 145 people reached the peak–as many as had achieved it between 1954 and 1996. And the mountaineers lined up in the worst possible place: a narrow, vertical passage below a hanging serac, a giant glacier that could collapse at any moment. It’s like standing in line to buy bread from a burning building. The Bottleneck has always ,, like a sword of Damocles. There have been avalanches and massive ice collapses in this area. Mountaineers celebrating their summit have had their ropes severed, trapping them on their descent. With the Bottleneck area jammed with aspirants, such an accident would be grotesque. In a video, Sherpa mountaineer Mingma G denounced the situation with images from July 22, the day that 145 people reached K2′s peak.,In January 2021, a team of 10 Nepalese climbers made history by completing the first-ever winter ascent of K2. Nirmal Purja and Mingma G’s teams joined forces. They looked not only to leave a mark on the history of Himalayanism, but also to expand their business. Both have since climbed K2 again, now leading a good number of clients by the hand. On social media, Nirmal Purja, the man who , by climbing the 14 eight-thousanders of the globe in just over six months, brags that he took 33 of his clients to the top on the same day.,Their work had traditionally been restricted to leading expeditions to eight-thousanders in spring and autumn. The Nepalese wanted to find new sources of income, especially in summer when monsoons make it impossible to get close to Nepal’s highest mountains. Opening their line of business to the five eight-thousanders located in Pakistan seemed like the best idea. The clients scaled the K2 with ease, reaching its top in a group. The extreme feat now seemed simple. Now the guides have copied ,, employing huge amounts of material and highly qualified Sherpa workers to guarantee fixed ropes to the top and, especially, at the Bottleneck. In a show of efficiency, the Sherpas placed a rope line for ascent and another for descent to prevent traffic jams from causing accidents.,Now, local companies, Nepalese agencies and Western guides are all working on K2. What was previously considered a mountain for climbers, a refuge for only the most autonomous and committed mountaineers, became, in just a year, a copy of Everest. Commercial interests, weather forecasts, kilometers of fixed ropes, hundreds of oxygen bottles and a large number of Sherpas from Nepal have made scaling the K2 accessible to the masses.,The wave of aspiring summiters, estimated at around 400 people, fits poorly into a mountain with few locations for high-altitude camps. Several climbers have reported fights to secure place in fields 1 and 2. They have taken turns using the tents on site during the acclimatization phase. The terrain is too steep to accommodate them all. Mingma G himself was also concerned about the heat in the area–just -17ºC registered at the top. The consequent rockfall on the route has already caused injuries to three workers. Days before the viral video recorded on July 22, many hopefuls reached Camp 4, at about 8,000 meters, to be in the front line and start the race when the fixed ropes were installed.,Currently, three fatal accidents have been unofficially registered, none of them in the Bottleneck area. And it’s worth remembering that, while in Nepal private helicopters fly to extract mountaineers from Everest and other eight-thousanders, in Pakistan, such flights are carried out by the army, only under orders of the military command.</td>\n",

      "How Disney overtook Netflix in subscriber numbers\n",
      "----------\n",
      "Disney has overtaken Netflix to become the TV streaming service with the highest number of subscribers. On Wednesday, the company announced that its three platforms – Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu – had 221.1 million subscribers worldwide, compared to,.,“We had an excellent quarter, with our world-class creative and business teams powering outstanding performance at our domestic theme parks, big increases in live-sports viewership, and significant subscriber growth at our streaming services. With 14.4 million Disney+ subscribers added in the fiscal third quarter, we now have 221 million total subscriptions across our streaming offerings,” said Bob Chapek, chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Company,.,It is, however, difficult to compare Disney and Netflix: the former has ,, while the latter has just one. According to the press release, Disney+ has 152.1 million subscribers, up 31% since last year, with most new subscribers outside the United States. ESPN+, which specializes in sport broadcasts, has grown 53% in one year, reaching 22.8 million subscribers. While, Hulu, which mainly broadcasts TV shows, has 46.2 million subscribers, a rise of 8%.,Disney’s rise to the top, however, may be short-lived. The total number of subscribers includes 58.4 million subscriptions to the Disney+ Hotstar service in India. This platform has lost the rights to broadcast cricket league matches, the country’s top sport, and analysts believe this could cost Disney millions in subscribers. In fact, the company downgraded subscriber forecast for September 2023, from between 230 million and 260 million to between 215 million and 245 million.,How much revenue Disney receives per subscriber varies greatly according to the service. Disney earns an average of $4.55 and $4.35 per customer for ESPN+ and Disney+, respectively. The latter platform includes the Hotstar service in India, which generates just $1.2 a month per subscription. In the United States, Disney earns an average of more than $6 per subscriber.,Disney has announced an ,. The service will be available from December 8, and cost $7.99 a month. Meanwhile, the cost of the ad-free Disney+ platform has increased to $10.99 a month. Hulu subscriptions have risen from $13.99 to $14.99 month, while its ad-supported offering will cost $7.99. For all three platforms, the monthly cost is $19.99 or $12.99 ad-supported subscriptions.,Both Netflix and Warner (HBO Max and Discovery) have announced plans to offer lower cost subscriptions, either supported by ads or that have a more limited offering.,Disney theme park revenues have also skyrocketed due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, with Disneyland Paris already recording pre-pandemic revenue. Disney also recorded an increase in theatrical distribution result due to box office hits such as ,. In the third quarter, Disney’s total revenue rose by 26%, to $21.5 billion, while net income shot up 53% to $1.5 billion, according to the company.\n"
